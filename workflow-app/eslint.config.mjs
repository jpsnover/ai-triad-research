// ESLint flat config (t/3847) — previously absent entirely: nothing linted this app.
// Scoped narrowly to what t/3847 asks for: rules-of-hooks (crash-class parity with the
// other renderer apps, t/2299) + complexity-budget (the ratchet gate this ticket exists
// to close the gap on). Mirrors poviewer/summary-viewer's non-type-aware pattern — the
// typescript-eslint parser is wired so .ts/.tsx files parse; no projectService needed
// since these rules are purely syntactic.
//
// Deliberately NOT wired here: require-flight-recorder-in-catch (ADR-003). This app has
// catch blocks but zero flight-recorder usage anywhere in its tree — enforcing that rule
// at 'error' would require retrofitting those catches first, a separate and larger job
// outside this ticket's scope (t/3847#1).
