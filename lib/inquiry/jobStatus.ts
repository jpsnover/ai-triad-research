// Inquiry job-status vocabulary + truncation derivation — the pure, host-agnostic core hoisted out
// of server/inquiryJobs.ts (t/3609). These are derivations over the shared InquiryResult contract
// (t/3574) and a status-label vocabulary; nothing here is server-specific. Both hosts consume the
// SAME symbols from here: the server (inquiryJobs.ts re-exports them), Electron main
// (inquiryHandlers.ts), and the renderer bridge contract (InquiryStatusResponse.status).
//
// What stays host-local (NOT here): the in-memory job Map, TTL sweep, per-user concurrency cap,
// idempotency, persistence, and the injected-pipeline seam — all genuinely per-host.

// calibrationLogger censor set). Anything else (e.g. 'natural') is a clean conclusion.
