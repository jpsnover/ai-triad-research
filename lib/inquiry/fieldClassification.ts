// Canonical field-classification matrix for InquiryResult exposure surfaces (t/3648, epic t/3618).
//
// InquiryResult (schema.ts) is a five-consumer `.passthrough()` contract projected onto THREE
// less-trusted-or-different surfaces, each of which was independently classifying the same fields —
// the drift risk that let `debateId` nearly leak on a green PR (t/3641/t/3651). This is the SINGLE
// SOURCE OF TRUTH those projections derive from:
//
//   • public-share  — anonymous, no-login share link (Server Auth, t/3623). Strictest.
//   • community     — authenticated cross-user browse (Server Community, t/3621/t/3651).
//   • export        — owner-initiated JSON/MD/PDF of one's OWN answer (Shared Lib, t/3624). Full fidelity.
//
// **Per-cell, per-surface, with a mandatory reason** (TL t/3651#2, SO e/198#7): one field can have
// three different correct answers — `debateId` is exclude / exclude / INCLUDE — so a single global
// allow/deny list is the wrong shape, and `exclude` is NEVER a reflexive default. Each cell states its
// surface's own trust context rather than inheriting from the strictest neighbour.
//
// Enforcement is `fieldClassification.test.ts`: it walks InquiryResultSchema for every leaf path and
// FAILS CLOSED if any (field, surface) is unclassified — so a new contract field cannot ship until it
// is deliberately classified on all three surfaces. Undeclared `.passthrough()` runtime fields are
// absent from every surface by construction (the projectors read only named/classified paths).
//
// Column ownership: public-share cells © Server Auth (t/3648#2); community cells © Server Community
// (t/3651#7); export cells © Shared Lib. Shared Lib owns this file, the helpers, and the CI gate.
