// The entity-mention index contract (entity-ontology-proposal §5, epic t/1890).
// `entity_mentions.json` maps a container to the entity references detected in its
// text — the unifier layer across the facts / POV / debate stores. Shipped
// interface-first (t/1893) so the indexer (B), read path (C), and resolver (D1)
// all build in parallel against one frozen shape.
//
// The whole file is a DERIVED ARTIFACT: nothing here is a source of truth. The
// retroactive re-index (§7) can rebuild it from containers plus approved entities,
// which is what licenses "apply-late-or-never" as a supported outcome. This is a
// type-only contract — no runtime logic lives here.
//
// ── GEOMETRY INVARIANT (Main-TL ruling, t/1893#4) ────────────────────────────────
// All mention geometry — `offset`, `quote`, and `text_sha256` — is defined over the
// NFC-CANONICAL form of the container text. Every producer AND every consumer MUST
// NFC-canonicalize the container text before computing OR applying an offset or hash.
// This is a decision, not a description of what any one implementation happens to do.
// Why it's load-bearing: if a producer hashes/offsets over NFC-canonical text but a
// consumer indexes the raw (non-NFC) text, then the moment a denormalized sequence
// appears earlier in the text, every `offset` points at the wrong character, `quote`
// fails to substring-match, and — worst — `text_sha256` never matches, so the
// supersession guard false-fires and silently drops every patch as "stale". Rare
// input, latent bug, miserable to debug. Decide once; consumers build to it. (NFC is
// already the basis D1's resolver and indexer B use for alias normalization, so this
// is consistent, not a new axis.) Consumers to hold to it: C (t/1895) re-hashes the
// NFC-canonical entry text; E (t/1898) NFC-canonicalizes before applying `offset`.
//
// ── CONTAINER-ID REGISTRY (one source of truth — producers mint, consumers parse) ─
// Every ContainerId is a self-describing, prefix-namespaced key, so a consumer routes
// by prefix and never sniffs the payload (Main-TL ratified, t/1894#7):
//   sei:<sei_key>            Curated fact bucket. <sei_key> = the source_evidence_index.json
//                            top-level key (a POV node id, e.g. "acc-desires-001").
//   node:<node_id>           Curated POV/situation node bucket. <node_id> = the node id.
//   <debate_id>#<entry_id>   Live debate turn (§5, Phase 2b) — one bucket per turn. Reserved
//                            for the live-extraction path; not produced by the batch re-index.
//
// ── CONTAINER-TEXT RECONSTRUCTION (C and E MUST reproduce this byte-identically) ───
// Rebuild the container text from source, then NFC-canonicalize the WHOLE string last
// (Geometry Invariant above): text_sha256 is over that NFC string, offset indexes into
// it, quote is its case-preserved slice. Per kind:
//   sei:   join each facts[].claim, in array order, with a single LF (U+000A).
//   node:  join label, description, plain_description — IN THAT FIXED ORDER — with a
//          blank line (two LF, U+000A U+000A).
// Byte-layout rules, all load-bearing (one divergence breaks text_sha256 → the
// supersession guard false-fires and drops every patch):
//   • An absent/empty field is OMITTED ENTIRELY — no empty segment, no doubled or
//     hanging delimiter.
//   • JOIN, not terminate-each: NO trailing delimiter.
//   • Element order is source order (facts[] as stored; each POV node is its own container).
//   • NEVER whitespace-collapse the container text — collapse is a matching-only step
//     (normalizeName) and must never touch the offset/hash basis.
//
// ── PRODUCER SCAN CONVENTION (shared by every scanner: batch re-index B + Phase 2b live) ─
// Alias-table keys and candidate spans are both normalized via normalizeName()
// (nameResolver.ts: NFC → lowercase → collapse the pinned whitespace set → trim). In free
// text, candidate spans are delimited by (?<!\w)…(?!\w) word boundaries on the NFC+lowercased
// text (so "Apollo" does not match inside "Apollonian"; internal '-'/digits in names like
// "GPT-4o" are literals, bounded only at the ends). Overlaps resolve longest-most-specific
// (ties: length desc, offset asc, entity_ref asc). Consumers (C read path) parse produced
// mentions and never re-scan.
