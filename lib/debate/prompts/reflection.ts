YOUR TASK: Identify 1-2 strong arguments that NONE of the debaters have made and that their assigned perspectives would be unlikely to make. Focus on:
- Cross-cutting positions that synthesize elements from multiple perspectives
- Compromise proposals that no single perspective would champion
- Blind spots where all three perspectives share an unstated assumption
- Strong arguments that are "homeless" — too nuanced for any single camp

For each argument:
- State it in 1-2 sentences as a clear, specific claim (not vague platitudes)
- Explain WHY no debater would make it given their assigned worldview
- Classify the gap type: cross_cutting, compromise, blind_spot, or unstated_assumption
- Identify which perspectives SHOULD engage with it (even if they wouldn't originate it)
- Classify the BDI layer: belief (empirical claim), desire (normative commitment), or intention (strategic reasoning)

- desire: one-sentence normative commitment this agreement serves for this POV
- intention: one-sentence strategic reasoning about HOW this POV would implement it
- summary: headline summary of this POV's interpretation

concept you would propose — even if you would word it differently — do NOT create a
duplicate. Instead, focus your edits on:
1. Nodes UNIQUE to your perspective that no other camp would propose
2. REVISE/QUALIFY edits to your EXISTING nodes based on what the debate revealed
3. If you agree with another camp's proposed node, that's fine — they own it. Move on.

The goal is ONE node per concept in the taxonomy, owned by whichever camp has the
strongest claim to it. Three camps proposing "Epistemic Asymmetry" is redundancy,
not convergence.\n`

=== YOUR CURRENT TAXONOMY (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) ===
${nodesBlock}

=== REFLECTION TASK ===

Reflect on this debate with intellectual honesty. Consider:

1. **Arguments you could not adequately defend** — Where did opponents expose weaknesses in your taxonomy nodes? Which of your claims had the lowest QBAF strength or were successfully attacked?
2. **Concessions you made** — Review your commitment store. What did you concede, and does your taxonomy reflect those concessions?
3. **Positions you argued that lack taxonomy backing** — Did you make strong arguments during the debate that have no corresponding BDI node?
4. **Convergence patterns** — Where are you converging with opponents? Does your taxonomy capture the nuance that emerged?
5. **Gaps between your taxonomy and your actual argumentation** — Were there nodes you never referenced because they were too vague, too broad, or simply wrong?
6. **Confidence and priority calibration** — Review the confidence/priority ratings on your nodes above. Did the debate reveal that any high-confidence Belief is weaker than rated, or any low-confidence Belief stronger? Are your Desire priorities still accurate after this exchange?

Based on this reflection, propose SPECIFIC EDITS to your own taxonomy nodes.

DISPOSITION — each suggestion chooses EXACTLY ONE (they are mutually exclusive):
- "edit_existing": modify an EXISTING node (the default reflection behavior — REVISE / QUALIFY / DEPRECATE below).
- "propose_new": introduce a genuinely NEW POV item AND wire it into the taxonomy with explicit edges. Leave every existing node untouched. Use this only when the debate surfaced a position that (a) has no existing node and (b) needs to be connected to the existing taxonomy to be meaningful.

Edit types (apply when disposition = "edit_existing" — all MODIFY an existing node; to CREATE a new node, use disposition "propose_new"):
- REVISE: update an existing node's label or description to better reflect what the debate revealed
- QUALIFY: add caveats or nuance to an existing node based on valid counterarguments
- DEPRECATE: mark a node as weak/unsupported if the debate effectively refuted it

PROPOSE-NEW rules (apply when disposition = "propose_new"):
- Provide: pov (accelerationist | safetyist | skeptic — normally your own), category (Beliefs | Desires | Intentions), label, description (genus-differentia format below), optional interpretations, and a rationale grounded in specific debate moments.
- proposed_edges: 1 or MORE edges connecting the new item to the EXISTING taxonomy. A propose_new with zero valid edges will be DISCARDED — an unconnected node is useless.
  - target_node_id: MUST be an EXISTING node id drawn from the taxonomy/context provided above (a pov-* id like "saf-beliefs-003", or a situation id like "sit-014"/"cc-042"). NEVER invent an id, NEVER use a transcript claim id (e.g. "AN-7"), and NEVER use a crux id.
  - edge_type: MUST be exactly one of the 8 canonical types: SUPPORTS, CONTRADICTS, ASSUMES, WEAKENS, RESPONDS_TO, TENSION_WITH, INTERPRETS, CONVERGES_WITH.
  - new_node_role: "source" if the new item is the origin of the edge, "target" if it is the destination.
  - rationale: one sentence, per edge, naming why this relationship holds (cite the debate moment).

Rules:
- Only propose edits with clear debate evidence. Do not suggest changes based on general knowledge.
- Labels: Desires use present participle targeting ideal state, Beliefs use noun phrase, Intentions use present participle denoting strategic action.
- Match the tone, abstraction level, and specificity of the existing taxonomy nodes above. Your proposed labels and descriptions should read as natural additions to the same taxonomy — not more abstract, not more concrete, not more colloquial, not more technical than the surrounding entries.
- Be intellectually honest — if an opponent landed a strong blow, acknowledge it.
- Propose 0 edits if nothing warrants change. Quality over quantity.
- Limit to your 3-5 most important edits.
- node_id rules: For REVISE/QUALIFY/DEPRECATE (the only edit_existing types), node_id MUST be a valid existing ID from YOUR taxonomy above (e.g. "saf-beliefs-003") — edit_existing NEVER creates a node. New nodes are created only via disposition "propose_new" (which generates the ID and wires edges).
- For each edit, assess your confidence: how strong is the debate evidence supporting this change?

DESCRIPTION FORMAT — all proposed descriptions MUST follow this exact 3-line structure:
  Line 1 (genus-differentia): "A [Belief|Desire|Intention] within [POV] discourse that [ONE distinguishing concept]."
    - The differentia states WHAT the position IS, not WHY it is correct.
    - ONE concept only. No causal connectors: do NOT use "rendering", "thereby", "thus", "therefore", "contingent on".
    - Do NOT pack mechanism + target + failure modes + caveats into one sentence.
  Line 2: "Encompasses: [3-5 sub-themes as comma-separated list]."
    - Sub-themes this node covers, all at the same abstraction level.
    - These are WHAT falls under this concept, not reasons WHY the position is correct.
  Line 3: "Excludes: [2-3 neighboring concepts]."
    - Concepts this node is NOT about. Name them neutrally.
    - Do NOT editorialize: "pre-deployment gatekeeping" is correct; "pre-deployment gatekeeping that functions as an anti-competitive compliance tax" is editorial.

  Do NOT add "Qualified by:", "Note:", "However:", or any other sections.
  Caveats and conditions belong in the assumes field or as separate nodes, NOT in the description.

  EXAMPLE (correct):
    "A Belief within safetyist discourse that current interpretability tools cannot provide formal verification of AI safety in deep neural networks.
    Encompasses: opacity of high-dimensional latent spaces, absence of proven causal links between internal activations and model behavior, limitations of mechanistic interpretability at scale.
    Excludes: the claim that model insights are theoretically impossible, transparency achieved through open-source code access."

REFLECTION LANGUAGE (applies to reflection_summary and rationale — proposed_description MUST stay in genus-differentia format):
Write reflection_summary for a general reader at a 10th-grade reading level.
Short, direct sentences — no nested clauses or academic hedging.
Active voice. Replace jargon with plain equivalents.
Name what changed in your thinking and why, in the simplest terms that preserve the specificity of your insight.
Do not sacrifice precision for brevity — cut the academic scaffolding, not the substance.
Write rationale in the same plain, direct style — name the debate moment, what it showed, and what you changed, without academic scaffolding.
