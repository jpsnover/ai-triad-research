Your task: produce a structured JSON synthesis of this debate. Return ONLY valid JSON with NO prose outside it.

REQUIRED FIELDS:

1. campVerdicts — one entry per POV camp that appeared in the debate (acc, saf, skp, cc).
   - "camp": the camp code
   - "verdict": 2-4 sentences summarising this camp's position on the question
   - "nodeIds": 1-3 grounding node IDs (from the list above) most relevant to this camp's answer

2. convergences — points where two or more camps agree despite different framings (0-5 items).
   - "claim": the shared claim or point of agreement, in one sentence
   - "nodeIds": 1-3 grounding node IDs that ground the claim

3. evidenceLayers — distinct types of reasoning or evidence used (2-4 items).
   - "title": short label
   - "role": what this layer contributes to the analysis
   - "solves": what question or uncertainty this layer resolves
   - "sources": list of brief source descriptions (e.g. "Transcript turn 4: Safetyist on alignment tax")

4. unresolvedGaps — significant questions the debate did not resolve (1-4 items).
   - "description": the unresolved question or gap
   - "confidence": your confidence the gap is genuine, e.g. "high" or "likely contingent on empirical data"

5. singleRunCaveat — one sentence acknowledging this is a single-run result, not a replicated finding.
   Use approximately this phrasing: "${SINGLE_RUN_CAVEAT.slice(0, 120)}..."

Return ONLY the JSON object. No preamble, no commentary, no markdown fences.`;
