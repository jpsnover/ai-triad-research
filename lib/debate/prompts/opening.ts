Analyze the topic${input.isFirst ? '' : ' and prior opening statements'} and produce a structured brief. Focus on:
1. What are the key dimensions of this topic that ${input.label}'s perspective can address?
2. What are the strongest angles ${input.label} can take? For each angle, identify which taxonomy nodes ground it.
3. What are the strongest claims ${input.label} can make from their perspective?
${input.isFirst ? '4. What framing will best establish this perspective for the audience?' : `4. What positions from prior speakers should ${input.label} acknowledge or contrast with?
5. What important dimensions of this topic have prior speakers not yet addressed? What assumptions are shared across perspectives that deserve examination?`}

For each strongest angle, assess evidence depth: what specific data, cases, or precedents ground it? Rate depth (deep/moderate/shallow). Shallow-depth angles should be narrowed to a specific claim your evidence can support, or reframed as questions the debate should explore.

GROUNDING DEPTH: Each angle and claim MUST cite 2-4 grounding nodes from the taxonomy — a primary anchor plus 1-3 supporting or contrasting nodes. Draw from different BDI categories (Beliefs for evidence, Desires for values, Intentions for strategy). A single-node grounding is too shallow — show the full argumentative structure.

GROUNDING WEIGHTS: For Belief grounding nodes, include "confidence" (0.0–1.0) from the taxonomy context. For Desire grounding nodes, include "priority" (1–5). For Intention grounding nodes, include "operationality" (1–5). These help downstream stages calibrate rhetorical strength.

SOURCE FIDELITY: Your situation_assessment must describe the debate topic as given — do not introduce concepts, framings, or policy domains that the topic and source material did not raise. If the source argues about ecosystem stability, do not reframe it as a governance debate. Characterize the actual disagreement, not a more convenient one. For every concept in your situation_assessment, cite the exact source phrase that warrants it in source_fidelity_check. If you cannot quote a source phrase for a concept, remove it from your assessment.

=== SITUATION BRIEF ===
${brief}

Plan your opening statement strategy. This is your first appearance — you need to:
1. Establish your core position clearly and memorably
2. Choose which 2-4 taxonomy nodes to build your argument around
3. Decide on the argumentative structure (claim + evidence + warrant for each main point)

Identify 1-2 specific claims from prior speakers to build on — name the claim and whether you EXTEND it (add supporting evidence), INTEGRATE it with your perspective, or use CONCEDE AND PIVOT (acknowledge its strength, then show where your evidence diverges). Strong openings advance the conversation, not just add to it. Rank your own claims by evidence depth — lead with your most grounded claim.`}

=== FIELD-AWARE STRATEGY ===
Your taxonomy nodes have epistemic_type, rhetorical_strategy, falsifiability, and assumes fields. Use them in planning:

EPISTEMIC TYPE — match argument mode to claim type:
- empirical_claim → argue with evidence
- normative_prescription → argue from coherence/values
- strategic_recommendation → challenge feasibility, cite analogous cases
- predictive → demand specific timelines and falsifiable thresholds
- definitional → use DISTINGUISH
- interpretive_lens → use REFRAME

RHETORICAL STRATEGY — plan HOW to argue based on your nodes' strategies:
- Techno_Optimism → lead with possibility. Pairs: EXTEND, REFRAME
- Precautionary_Framing → lead with stakes. Pairs: EMPIRICAL CHALLENGE, SPECIFY
- Appeal_To_Evidence → lead with data. Pairs: EMPIRICAL CHALLENGE, UNDERCUT
- Structural_Critique → lead with systems. Pairs: REFRAME, DISTINGUISH
- Moral_Imperative → lead with obligation. Pairs: COUNTEREXAMPLE, CONCEDE-AND-PIVOT
- Cost_Benefit_Analysis → lead with tradeoffs. Pairs: DISTINGUISH, SPECIFY, INTEGRATE
- Analogical_Reasoning → lead with precedent. Pairs: COUNTEREXAMPLE, EXTEND
- Inevitability_Framing → lead with trajectory. Pairs: REFRAME, EXTEND
- Pragmatic_Framing → lead with what works. Pairs: COUNTEREXAMPLE, INTEGRATE

FALSIFIABILITY — calibrate evidence demands:
- HIGH → cite concrete evidence and measurable outcomes
- MEDIUM → separate testable parts from judgment calls
- LOW → argue from coherence/values, not pseudo-empirical claims

ASSUMPTIONS — your nodes list their assumptions. Name 1-2 key assumptions your position depends on and plan how to handle challenges to them.

Before introducing your own position, show that you understand the strongest version of each prior speaker's argument — not just acknowledge it, but articulate why it's compelling. Then identify where your evidence leads in a different direction. Name the specific tension: what would have to be true for both positions to hold? Strong openings surface the real disagreement, not just assert the opposite.

IMPORTANT: You may only attribute named positions to speakers whose openings appear in the PRIOR OPENING POSITIONS section above. If only one speaker has spoken, do not use 'they' or 'both positions' — name the specific speaker. Do not attribute positions to speakers who have not yet delivered their opening.`}

Execute the argument plan above. Write your opening statement following the plan's structure.

OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS:
- NODE-ID PROHIBITION: Never surface taxonomy node IDs in statement text. Use plain language.
- CLAIM SPECIFICITY: At least one claim per paragraph must include a concrete number, named entity, date, or threshold. If source evidence is provided above, use it — cite the specific statistic, year, or finding rather than paraphrasing vaguely. Abstract claims without any specifics weaken your argument.
- CLAIM SKETCHING: For each paragraph, identify 1-3 distinct claims it makes — the paragraph's main point plus any sub-claim substantial enough to stand as its own argument. A dense paragraph with several specific claims (statistics, named precedents, conditional arguments) should yield more sketches than a paragraph with one simple point. For each, extract a near-verbatim sentence.
- TURN SYMBOLS: Choose 1-3 Unicode symbols (emoji) that capture your argument's essence. Tooltip: 1-sentence analogy connecting the symbol to your argument.
- EPISTEMIC DEPTH: Prefer narrow, evidence-grounded claims over broad assertions. A claim backed by a specific statistic, case, or precedent generates more productive engagement than a sweeping generalization. Ask: 'Does this claim invite a substantive response, or just a dismissal?' If the latter, narrow it until a thoughtful opponent would need to bring counter-evidence rather than just disagree.

PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE:
- 3-5 paragraphs separated by \\n\\n. Each develops one distinct idea.
- A single unbroken block will be rejected — structure your argument into clear, quotable sections.
