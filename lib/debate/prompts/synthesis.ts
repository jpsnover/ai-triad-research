CRITICAL — CONCESSION AWARENESS:
Before classifying any point as a "disagreement," check whether a debater WITHDREW, CONCEDED, or REVISED their position during the debate. If a debater initially proposed X but later abandoned it and endorsed an opponent's alternative, that is NOT a disagreement — it is a RESOLVED point that belongs in areas_of_agreement. The FINAL positions matter, not the initial ones.

Identify:
1. Areas where the debaters agree — include both initial agreements AND points where debaters CONVERGED during the debate (initially disagreed but one side conceded). For converged points, note who conceded and what changed their mind.
2. Areas where they genuinely STILL disagree at the END of the debate (with each debater's FINAL stance, not their opening position)
3. For each disagreement, classify:
   a. "type": EMPIRICAL, VALUES, or DEFINITIONAL
   b. "bdi_layer": "belief" (empirical disagreement), "desire" (value priorities differ), or "intention" (key terms defined differently)
   c. "resolvability": MUST match bdi_layer — belief → "resolvable_by_evidence", desire → "negotiable_via_tradeoffs", intention → "requires_term_clarification". No exceptions.
4. Cruxes — specific questions that, if answered, would change a debater's position.
   For each crux, FIRST decide whether it is counterfactual at all. A crux is counterfactual only if it reasons about a state contrary to fact. If it is a direct empirical or definitional question, set counterfactual_type to "none". Otherwise classify:
   - "interventional" (Pearl do-calculus): asks what would happen if a variable were FORCED to a value — "If we imposed strict liability, would developers exit?"
   - "backtracking" (Lewis): runs causal history backwards — "If the 2022 regulation had passed, would the landscape look different?"
   - "normative": asks what follows from adopting a value or rule — "If we adopted the precautionary principle, what would change?"
5. Questions that remain unresolved

=== NEUTRALIZATION PASS ===
After completing your analysis, review every free-text field before writing the final JSON:
- PRESERVE: all substantive claims, factual content, and structural relationships (agreement/disagreement classifications, crux logic)
- NEUTRALIZE: stance-loaded vocabulary (e.g., "reckless," "visionary"), camp-specific rhetorical moves (accelerationist urgency framing, safetyist catastrophism, skeptic dismissiveness), and emotional register tied to one position
- "point" and "question" fields must read as neutral descriptions of the issue, not as advocacy for either side
- Attributed fields ("stance", "if_yes", "if_no") may retain position-specific language since they describe which debater must concede, but strip emotional amplification (e.g., "argues X is dangerous" → "argues X poses risks")

=== FULL TRANSCRIPT ===
${transcript}

Tasks:
1. Which taxonomy nodes were referenced and how they were used
2. Build an argument map: extract key claims and their relationships
   - Each claim gets an ID (C1, C2, ...), near-verbatim text, and who made it
   - For each claim, list supports (supported_by) and attacks (attacked_by)
   - Classify attacks: "rebut", "undercut", or "undermine"
   - Note dialectical scheme: CONCEDE, DISTINGUISH, REFRAME, COUNTEREXAMPLE, REDUCE, or ESCALATE
   - Classify the argumentation_scheme: ARGUMENT_FROM_EVIDENCE, ARGUMENT_FROM_EXPERT_OPINION, ARGUMENT_FROM_PRECEDENT, ARGUMENT_FROM_CONSEQUENCES, ARGUMENT_FROM_ANALOGY, PRACTICAL_REASONING, ARGUMENT_FROM_DEFINITION, ARGUMENT_FROM_VALUES, ARGUMENT_FROM_FAIRNESS, ARGUMENT_FROM_IGNORANCE, SLIPPERY_SLOPE, ARGUMENT_FROM_RISK, ARGUMENT_FROM_METAPHOR, or OTHER
   - For attacks, note which critical_question_addressed (1-4) the attack targets — e.g., challenging an analogy on CQ2 means "important differences prevent transfer"
   - Each claim must be traceable to the transcript${documentAnalysis}
3. Identify concepts discussed in this debate that are NOT covered by any existing taxonomy node. For each, propose a new node with a label (3-8 words), genus-differentia description, POV, category, and rationale explaining why this debate surfaced a gap. Link to the claim IDs that motivated the proposal.
   LABEL FORMAT BY CATEGORY:
   - Desires: present participle targeting an ideal state (e.g., "Mitigating Automation Displacement", "Ensuring Algorithmic Accountability", "Democratizing AI Access")
   - Beliefs: noun phrase denoting a phenomenon, principle, or empirical claim (e.g., "Inherent Power-Seeking Behavior", "Cognitive Atrophy from AI Reliance")
   - Intentions: present participle denoting strategic action or policy posture (e.g., "Mandating Algorithmic Audits", "Prioritizing Interpretability Research")
   Never start labels with "The", "A", or "An". Never include parenthetical abbreviations.
   DESCRIPTION RULES: Use domain-specific terminology — no colloquialisms. Every description must include Encompasses: and Excludes: clauses.
4. Identify existing taxonomy nodes that should be modified based on what this debate revealed — descriptions that are too narrow, categories that are wrong, or nodes that should be split. For each, specify the node ID, modification type, suggested change, and rationale.

=== NEUTRALIZATION PASS ===
After completing your analysis, review every free-text field before writing the final JSON:
- PRESERVE: all substantive claims, claim relationships (supported_by, attacked_by), argumentation structure, and taxonomy mappings
- NEUTRALIZE: stance-loaded vocabulary, camp-specific rhetorical moves, and emotional register tied to one position
- "claim" fields should preserve substantive content while removing gratuitous emotional loading — keep the argument, strip the spin
- "how_used", "rationale", "description", and "suggested_change" fields must read as neutral analytical observations
- Taxonomy proposals (label, description) must use domain terminology, never camp rhetoric

=== FULL TRANSCRIPT ===
${transcript}

CRITICAL — CONCESSION AWARENESS:
Before classifying any point as a "disagreement," check whether a debater WITHDREW,
CONCEDED, or REVISED their position during the debate. If a debater initially proposed
X but later abandoned it and endorsed an opponent's alternative, that is NOT a
disagreement — it is a RESOLVED point that belongs in areas_of_agreement. Look for
explicit concession language ("I withdraw," "I accept," "I endorse [opponent]'s
approach instead," "fair point — I'll drop that") and for positions that evolved
across turns. The FINAL positions matter, not the initial ones. A debate that starts
with disagreement and ends with convergence has FEWER disagreements than the opening
statements suggest.

Identify:
1. Areas where the debaters agree — include both initial agreements AND points where
   debaters CONVERGED during the debate (initially disagreed but one side conceded).
   For converged points, note who conceded and what changed their mind.
2. Areas where they genuinely STILL disagree at the end of the debate (with each
   debater's FINAL stance, not their opening position)
3. For each disagreement, classify:
   a. "type": EMPIRICAL, VALUES, or DEFINITIONAL (as before)
   b. "bdi_layer": which layer of the debaters' worldview this disagreement lives in:
      - "belief" — they disagree about what is empirically true (facts, evidence, predictions)
      - "desire" — they share the facts but prioritize differently (goals, principles, trade-offs)
      - "intention" — they define a key term or concept differently (meaning, scope, framing)
   c. "resolvability": MUST match bdi_layer exactly — no exceptions:
      - belief → "resolvable_by_evidence"
      - desire → "negotiable_via_tradeoffs"
      - intention → "requires_term_clarification"
4. Cruxes — the specific factual or value questions that, if resolved, would change a debater's position. A good crux is a question where one debater would say "if the answer turned out to be X, I would actually change my position."
   For each crux, FIRST decide whether it is counterfactual at all. A crux is counterfactual only if it reasons about a state contrary to fact. If it is a direct empirical or definitional question, set counterfactual_type to "none". Otherwise classify:
   - "interventional": asks what would happen if a variable were forced to a value (Pearl do-calculus)
   - "backtracking": runs causal history backwards — what would have been different? (Lewis)
   - "normative": asks what follows from adopting a value, principle, or rule
5. Questions that remain unresolved
6. Which taxonomy nodes were referenced and how they were used
7. Build an argument map: extract the key claims from the transcript and show how they relate
   - Each claim gets an ID (C1, C2, ...), the verbatim or near-verbatim text, and who made it
   - For each claim, list which other claims support it (supported_by) and which attack it
   - For attacks, classify the attack_type:
     "rebut" — directly contradicts the claim's conclusion (e.g., COUNTEREXAMPLE, REDUCE)
     "undercut" — accepts the evidence but denies the inference (e.g., DISTINGUISH)
     "undermine" — attacks the credibility or relevance of the claim's source
   - For attacks, note which dialectical scheme was used: CONCEDE, DISTINGUISH, REFRAME, COUNTEREXAMPLE, REDUCE, or ESCALATE
   - Classify the argumentation_scheme: ARGUMENT_FROM_EVIDENCE, ARGUMENT_FROM_EXPERT_OPINION, ARGUMENT_FROM_PRECEDENT, ARGUMENT_FROM_CONSEQUENCES, ARGUMENT_FROM_ANALOGY, PRACTICAL_REASONING, ARGUMENT_FROM_DEFINITION, ARGUMENT_FROM_VALUES, ARGUMENT_FROM_FAIRNESS, ARGUMENT_FROM_IGNORANCE, SLIPPERY_SLOPE, ARGUMENT_FROM_RISK, ARGUMENT_FROM_METAPHOR, or OTHER
   - For attacks, note which critical_question_addressed (1-4) the attack targets
   - Each claim must be traceable to something actually said in the transcript
8. For each area of disagreement, evaluate which position is STRONGER and why.
   Apply these preference criteria (in order of priority):
   a. "empirical_evidence" — which position cites more or better evidence?
   b. "logical_validity" — which position has fewer logical gaps or fallacies?
   c. "source_authority" — which position draws on more authoritative sources?
   d. "specificity" — which position is more concrete and testable?
   e. "scope" — which position accounts for more of the relevant considerations?
   A position can prevail on one criterion while losing on another.

=== FULL STATEMENT CONTEXT ===
${statementContext}

=== RELEVANT TAXONOMY POSITIONS ===
${taxonomyNodes}

=== KNOWN CONFLICTS AND WEB EVIDENCE ===
${conflictData || '(No relevant conflicts or web results found)'}

Evaluate whether this claim is factually accurate using ALL available evidence:
1. Internal evidence: Is it consistent with the taxonomy data and known research conflicts?
2. External evidence: Do the web search results support or contradict it? Cite specific findings.
3. Internal consistency: Does it align with other statements in the debate?
4. Temporal accuracy: Is it current, or does it rely on outdated information?

Rate the claim on the VERDICT axis — the polarity of the *core* claim. Pick exactly one:
- "supported" — the core claim AND its material details are corroborated by the weight of evidence. Exact figures and immaterial rounding count as supported. Use this when nothing material is off.
- "partially_accurate" — the core claim's DIRECTION is corroborated, but the evidence identifies a SPECIFIC, MATERIAL discrepancy in a detail (e.g. "12 states" when the truth is 10). This is a *support* verdict with one named error. You MUST populate the "discrepancy" object below. Do NOT use this for a vague "roughly right" hunch with no nameable, sourced error — if nothing is off, use "supported"; if the substance itself is contested or unconfirmable, use "disputed"/"unverifiable".
- "disputed" — a *contested* verdict: authoritative sources conflict on the claim's CENTRAL assertion and the evidence is mixed, not decisive. This is NOT for peripheral detail errors (those are "partially_accurate") — reserve it for genuine dispute about the substance.
- "false" — the central assertion is DIRECTLY contradicted by authoritative sources: the direction is wrong, decisively (not merely a detail that is off).
- "unverifiable" — the claim can be neither confirmed nor denied with available evidence (web search found nothing relevant). This is absence of evidence, not counter-evidence.

When the verdict is "partially_accurate", emit a "discrepancy" object naming the error and sourcing the truth:
- "dimension": one of "magnitude" (off-by-N count/percentage) | "temporal" (stale/wrong date) | "attribution" (right fact, wrong actor/source) | "scope" (over/under-generalized, e.g. "all" vs "some") | "existence" (phenomenon real, a specific instance wrong)
- "claimed": what the speaker asserted, verbatim (the figure/detail)
- "actual": what the evidence shows
- "source": the node_id, conflict_id, or url that establishes "actual"
- "severity": "minor" (does not change the claim's force) | "major" (materially weakens the reasoning, though the direction still holds)
A "partially_accurate" verdict WITHOUT a discrepancy carrying claimed + actual + source will be REJECTED and downgraded — you cannot use it as a hedge.

When web search results are available, cite them specifically in your explanation.

Before the debate begins, you need to help the user focus. Generate 1 to 3 clarifying questions that:
- Identify the document's 2-3 most debatable claims — the ones where the three AI policy perspectives (accelerationist, safetyist, skeptic) would disagree most sharply
- Ask which of these claims or tensions the user most wants to explore
- Surface whether the user is more interested in the document's empirical claims (are the facts right?), its normative framing (are the values right?), or its methodology (is the reasoning sound?)
- Note any key terms the document defines in a way that different perspectives would contest
- Be neutral — do not favor any perspective
- Be concise (one sentence each)

IMPORTANT: Your questions must be REFINEMENT questions that help the user decide what to focus on — not debate propositions that the agents would argue about. Good: "Which of the paper's claims do you most want the debaters to challenge?" Bad: "Should the paper's recommendation for mandatory AI audits be adopted?"

For each question, generate 3-5 answer options that cover the reasonable answer space. Options should be:
- Topic-specific and substantive (not generic like "yes/no")
- Mutually distinct — each option steers the debate in a different direction
- 1-2 sentences each

- Be concise (one sentence each)

TAXONOMY NODES REFERENCED IN THIS DEBATE:
${nodesBlock}

For each node above, assess whether the debate revealed that its description should change.
A node needs revision when:
- It was TOO VAGUE to defend — debaters couldn't make specific claims from it → CLARIFY (add specifics)
- It was TOO BROAD — debaters could only engage with part of it → NARROW (tighten scope)
- It was TOO NARROW — the debate surfaced valid points the node excludes → BROADEN (expand scope)
- It should be SPLIT — the debate revealed it conflates two distinct positions → SPLIT
- It was effectively REFUTED — strong counterarguments with no adequate defense → QUALIFY (add caveats) or RETIRE
- A strong position was argued that NO existing node represents → NEW_NODE

For each suggestion:
- Write the COMPLETE proposed_description, not just a diff. Follow the genus-differentia format:
  POV nodes: "A [Belief|Desire|Intention] within [POV] discourse that [differentia]. Encompasses: [what it covers]. Excludes: [boundaries]."
  New nodes should follow the same pattern.
- LABEL FORMAT BY CATEGORY:
  Desires: present participle targeting an ideal state (e.g., "Mitigating Automation Displacement", "Ensuring Algorithmic Accountability")
  Beliefs: noun phrase denoting a phenomenon, principle, or empirical claim (e.g., "Inherent Power-Seeking Behavior", "Cognitive Atrophy from AI Reliance")
  Intentions: present participle denoting strategic action or policy posture (e.g., "Mandating Algorithmic Audits", "Prioritizing Interpretability Research")
  Never start labels with "The", "A", or "An". Never include parenthetical abbreviations.
- DESCRIPTION RULES: Use domain-specific terminology — no colloquialisms. Every description must include Encompasses: and Excludes: clauses.
- The rationale must cite specific debate evidence (claims, counterarguments, concessions).
- Only suggest changes with clear debate evidence. Do NOT suggest changes based on general knowledge.
- Suggest 0 items if no changes are warranted — do not force suggestions.
