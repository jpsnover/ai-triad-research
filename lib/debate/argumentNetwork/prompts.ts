STATEMENT by ${speaker}:

PRIOR CLAIMS IN THIS DEBATE:
${priorBlock}

For each distinct claim in the statement:
1. Extract the claim as a near-verbatim sentence from the statement
2. If it responds to a prior claim, classify the relationship:
   - "supports" with a warrant (WHY it supports — the reasoning pattern).
     Use "supports" for concession moves: when the speaker grants, agrees with, or accepts an opponent's claim. Schemes for support: ${SUPPORT_SCHEMES}.
   - "attacks" with attack_type ("rebut" = contradicts conclusion, "undercut" = denies the inference, "undermine" = attacks premise credibility) and scheme (${ATTACK_SCHEMES})
   NOTE: A CONCEDE-AND-PIVOT move often produces TWO edges — a "supports" edge for the conceded portion and an "attacks" edge for the pivot. Include both in responds_to.
   - "strength": classify the engagement strength as ONE of:
     "decisive" — directly rebuts/supports with specific evidence or logical entailment
     "substantial" — clear engagement with some evidence or reasoning
     "tangential" — loosely related, weak or indirect connection
     Do NOT output numeric weights. Use ONLY these three categories.
   - "argumentation_scheme": classify the reasoning pattern being used. Pick ONE:
     ARGUMENT_FROM_EVIDENCE — supported by specific data or measurements
     ARGUMENT_FROM_EXPERT_OPINION — supported by expert testimony or institutional authority
     ARGUMENT_FROM_PRECEDENT — supported by a historical case or legal precedent
     ARGUMENT_FROM_CONSEQUENCES — based on predicted outcomes of an action
     ARGUMENT_FROM_ANALOGY — draws a parallel to another domain
     PRACTICAL_REASONING — advocates an action as means to a stated goal
     ARGUMENT_FROM_DEFINITION — depends on how a key term is defined
     ARGUMENT_FROM_VALUES — grounded in an explicit value or ethical principle
     ARGUMENT_FROM_FAIRNESS — appeals to equal treatment or proportionality
     ARGUMENT_FROM_IGNORANCE — derives conclusion from absence of evidence
     SLIPPERY_SLOPE — claims a small action leads to extreme outcomes through a chain
     ARGUMENT_FROM_RISK — advocates caution based on magnitude of potential harm
     ARGUMENT_FROM_METAPHOR — uses a metaphor or figurative frame to structure reasoning about the target domain (e.g., "AI development is a race", "regulation is red tape", "alignment is taming a genie")
     OTHER — if none fit (include brief description)
3. If it's a new standalone claim, responds_to should be an empty array

Extract 3-6 claims. Each claim must be traceable to text actually in the statement. Do NOT invent claims. Prefer more rather than fewer — include secondary and supporting claims, not just the headline assertion.

For each claim, also classify:
- "extraction_confidence": how faithfully this claim captures what the speaker actually said (0-1):
  0.9-1.0: near-verbatim sentence from the statement
  0.7-0.89: faithful compression, core meaning preserved
  0.5-0.69: implicit premise or reading between the lines
  Below 0.5: do not include — you are editorializing beyond the statement
- "bdi_category": "belief" (empirical/factual claim), "desire" (normative/value claim), or "intention" (strategic/methodological claim)
  PRECEDENCE RULE when surface cues conflict:
    1. If the span specifies a METHOD or MECHANISM → "intention" (regardless of "should"/"must")
    2. If the span states a desired end-state WITHOUT mechanism → "desire"
    3. If the span makes an empirical claim (true/false evaluable) → "belief"
- "canonical_proposition": Rewrite the claim as a single formal sentence (≤30 words) stripped of debate rhetoric, hedging, and informal language. Match modal register to BDI type:
  Beliefs: indicative ("X is/causes Y")
  Desires: deontic ("X ought to be the case")
  Intentions: instrumental ("Achieve X by means of Y")
  Use controlled vocabulary terms where applicable. This field is used for taxonomy matching — precision matters.
- "attribution_text": Rewrite this claim mirroring taxonomy node description format:
  "A [Belief|Desire|Intention] within [POV] discourse that [differentia]. Encompasses: [2-3 specific concepts from the claim]."
  Rules:
  1. Use BDI modal form (beliefs=indicative, desires=deontic, intentions=instrumental)
  2. Replace colloquial phrasing with domain vocabulary (see PREFERRED DOMAIN TERMINOLOGY above)
  3. Be specific — name concrete mechanisms, not broad categories
  4. Resolve pronouns, decode metaphors, name the policy domain
  5. 40-80 words. Do not add claims not in the original.
- "base_strength": FOR BELIEF CLAIMS ONLY. Classify the evidential grounding as ONE of:
  "grounded" — cites specific data, named sources, dates, or directly verifiable facts
  "reasoned" — logical argument with internal coherence but no specific evidence
  "asserted" — claim stated without supporting reasoning or evidence
  Do NOT output numeric scores. Use ONLY these three categories.
  For desire and intention claims: OMIT base_strength entirely — use bdi_sub_scores instead.
- "bdi_sub_scores": for each criterion, answer "yes", "partial", or "no":
  For belief claims: OMIT bdi_sub_scores — use "belief_verification" instead (see below)
  For desire claims: {"values_grounding": "yes/partial/no", "tradeoff_acknowledgment": "yes/partial/no", "precedent_citation": "yes/partial/no"}
  For intention claims: {"mechanism_specificity": "yes/partial/no", "scope_bounding": "yes/partial/no", "failure_mode_addressing": "yes/partial/no"}
- "belief_verification": REQUIRED for belief claims ONLY. Answer each sub-step:
  {"evidence_cited": "what specific evidence does this claim cite (1 sentence, or 'none')",
   "source_located": "found" (evidence traceable to the source document) | "not_found" (claim cites evidence not in the source) | "no_source" (claim cites no specific evidence),
   "evidence_supports": "strongly" (evidence directly entails the claim) | "partially" (evidence is relevant but doesn't fully support) | "weakly" (loose connection) | "contradicts" (evidence works against the claim),
   "counter_evidence": "none" (no contradicting info in the source) | "minor" (some tension but not decisive) | "significant" (source contains strong counter-evidence),
   "ambiguity_resolved": "none" (the source makes a clear, unambiguous claim) | "acknowledged" (the source hedges or presents multiple readings, and this extraction preserves that uncertainty) | "collapsed" (the source hedges or presents multiple readings, but this extraction picks one and states it as settled)}
- "specificity": "precise" (contains specific numbers, dates, named entities, or directly verifiable facts), "general" (broad empirical claim without specific verifiable details), or "abstract" (theoretical/normative, not empirically testable)
- "steelman_of": null normally. Set to the opponent's name (e.g. "Accelerationist") ONLY when this claim deliberately presents the STRONGEST version of an opponent's position before critiquing it. A steelman means restating someone else's argument charitably — not attacking it.
${topic ? `- "topic_relevance": "on_topic" (directly engages the stated scope), "adjacent" (related but requires inference to connect), or "off_topic" (examples or framing contradict explicit topic constraints)
` : ''}${audience === 'policymakers' ? `
- "political_salience": classify each claim's relevance to political decision-making:
  "high" = Names a specific bill, agency, budget line, executive order, identifiable constituency, or references a specific court ruling or legal standard (e.g., Chevron deference, Section 230, strict liability standard). The claim could appear in a committee hearing or regulatory comment letter.
  "medium" = Relevant to governance but requires translation to connect to a pending decision. Discusses institutional structures, regulatory frameworks, or enforcement in general terms.

REPETITION RULE: Do NOT restate a point you have already made. The audience has heard it.
If an opponent hasn't addressed your point, say "I note that no one has responded to my argument
that [brief reference]" — then move to a NEW argument or develop a DIFFERENT angle.
If you want to reinforce a prior point, add NEW evidence or a NEW example — do not restate
the same logic with different words.

CONSISTENCY RULE: Do not contradict your prior assertions without explicitly acknowledging
the change. If you now believe differently, say "I previously argued X, but on reflection..."
— do not silently flip.\n`;
