# agent-file-owner.sh — answer "which repo owns this AGENTS.md?" in one command,
# and fail when the answer is ambiguous or missing (t/2080).
#
# WHY: this project spans three repos with different rules — the public code repo
# (`git`), the private Orca overlay (`git --git-dir=.orca-git`), and the SSH data
# repo. `AGENTS.md` was tracked in the first two with NO coordination between
# them, so "which repo does this file belong to" had to be answered per file,
# from memory, at commit time. Two concrete failures that produced:
#   • root `AGENTS.md` was tracked in BOTH repos and silently DIVERGED — the
#     overlay carried a stale pre-refactor revision behind main's current one,
#     surviving at least one hand-reconcile (overlay 6675678, t/2066).
#   • two role files (`…/components/chat/AGENTS.md`, `…/components/settings/`)
#     were tracked in NEITHER repo — ignored by main, never `add -f`d into the
#     overlay. They existed in exactly one place on one machine, one
#     `git clean -xfd` from unrecoverable. Recovered at overlay 01d782f.
# The second case is the important one: the answer set is not {main, overlay} but
# {main, overlay, NEITHER}, and NEITHER is invisible to both repos' `status`.
#
# THE RULE this enforces (stated as a predicate, not a per-file convention):
#   An AGENTS.md is MAIN-repo-tracked iff a PUBLIC-repo consumer needs it
#   without the overlay. Everything else is OVERLAY-tracked. Never both.
# Today that predicate yields exactly the two paths in MAIN_OWNED below.
#
# USAGE:
#   sh .githooks/agent-file-owner.sh --path <file>   # → main | overlay | NEITHER
#   sh .githooks/agent-file-owner.sh --audit         # → exit 1 on any violation
#
# EXIT CODES: 0 = clean, 1 = violation found (audit), 2 = internal error.
# Callers that must not block on a broken guard should treat ONLY 1 as fatal.

# The complete set of AGENTS.md the MAIN repo tracks. Adding a path here is a
# deliberate act: it publishes that file to the public repo. The matching
# re-exclusions live in `.orca-gitignore` — the two lists must stay disjoint,
# which is what check 1 below enforces.
#
#   AGENTS.md                            — root project instructions; a public
#                                          contributor cloning only the code repo
#                                          needs these to build and test.
#   operations/devops/azure/AGENTS.md    — Azure deploy/runbook detail, referenced
#                                          by name from the root file; a dangling
#                                          reference in the public repo is worse
#                                          than the content being public.
