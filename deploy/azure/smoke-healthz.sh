# Pre-deploy runtime smoke: run a container image the way prod runs it and
# prove /healthz becomes ready. Catches "image builds + inits fully but never
# reports ready" — the failure class that took down prod in t/2047 (a base
# node bump broke the github-api data load → /healthz stayed 503 → crash-loop),
# which the build-only CI container gate passed green (t/2047 gap #1, t/1589).
#
# Usage:  IMAGE=<ref> GITHUB_TOKEN=<tok> deploy/azure/smoke-healthz.sh
#   IMAGE         required — the image ref (tag or @sha256 digest) to smoke.
#   GITHUB_TOKEN  required — public read is enough (jpsnover/ai-triad-data is
#                 public); the readiness gate needs the github-api fetch to
#                 succeed, which is exactly the path the t/2047 regression broke.
#
# Exit 0 = /healthz returned 200 within the window (healthy).
# Exit 1 = never became ready, or the container died (the crash-loop signature).

# SMOKE_MODE selects what "healthy" means:
#   liveness  — pass as soon as /healthz RESPONDS with any HTTP status (server
#               is up + serving). Does NOT require data. This is the CI gate
#               (ci.yml test-container): a CI-built image bakes only a STUB
#               snapshot and cannot reach real data-readiness, so CI can only
#               prove the container starts and answers. Catches boot crashes /
#               port-never-listens — strictly better than the old build-only gate.
#   readiness — pass only on /healthz==200 (taxonomy data actually loaded via the
#               github-api fetch). This is the DEPLOY-stage gate (t/2049, real env
#               + creds); it's what catches the t/2047 class (starts but never
#               data-ready). da74e499 RED / efd068fe GREEN is its AC.
