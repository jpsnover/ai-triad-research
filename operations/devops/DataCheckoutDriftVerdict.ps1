.SYNOPSIS
    Pure predicate: should the hourly drift check alarm on a shared DATA checkout
    (ai-triad-data / ai-triad-sources)? Detection only — never commits, deletes, or syncs
    anything. (t/4005, the surviving vector from t/4001: 63 uncommitted ingested sources
    sat for ~3 weeks, backed up nowhere, found only by chance.)
.DESCRIPTION
    check-shared-drift.ps1 (r/11) covers only the CODE checkout; nothing watched either data
    checkout. This predicate is the data-side equivalent, scoped to what matters for data:
    uncommitted work going stale, and uncommitted work that a future sync would conflict with.

    Alarm iff ANY of:
      (a) uncommitted work (tracked-modified OR untracked) is older than AgeThresholdHours;
      (b) a tracked-modified path intersects IncomingPaths — origin/main will touch a file
          this checkout has modified but not committed;
      (c) an untracked path intersects IncomingPaths — origin/main is about to ADD a file at
          a path this checkout already has an untracked (uncommitted, unbacked-up) copy of.
          (Structural note: a path in IncomingPaths that is also UNTRACKED locally cannot be
          a local modify-conflict — if the path were already tracked at HEAD, the local copy
          would be tracked too, not untracked. So any Untracked∩IncomingPaths hit is
          necessarily an incoming ADD colliding with local uncommitted work — no separate
          `git diff --name-status` pass is needed to tell add from modify.)
      (d) diverged (Ahead > 0 AND Behind > 0) — ahead+behind at once means local commits exist
          that origin/main doesn't have AND origin/main has commits this checkout doesn't;
          either direction's resolution risks the other's uncommitted work.

    Behind-only (Behind > 0, Ahead = 0, no intersection) is explicitly NOT an alarm — only an
    info line in Reasons. A data checkout trailing origin/main with no conflicting local edits
    is normal and does not need an owner-claim.

    FAIL-SAFE on missing age data: if there IS uncommitted work (tracked-modified or untracked
    non-empty) but $OldestUncommittedMtime is $null (the caller could not stat it — e.g. a
    long-path read failure), age is treated as INFINITE (always over threshold), never as "no
    age, so no alarm." A file whose age cannot be determined must never read as fresh.

    PURE: takes already-computed sets/counts/timestamp, returns the verdict. The impure git
    calls, file mtime reads (long-path `\\?\`-prefixed, t/4005), and per-checkout error
    handling live in check-data-checkout-drift.ps1. Mirrors DriftSyncVerdict.ps1 /
    DriftPhantomVerdict.ps1 — unverified errors (unreadable repo, git/fetch failure) are the
    CALLER's job to turn into Alarm=$true + QueryError, bypassing this function entirely for
    that checkout; this function is never called with an error to represent.
.PARAMETER Name
    Checkout label (e.g. 'ai-triad-data'), carried through to the result for reporting.
.PARAMETER TrackedModified
    Paths with uncommitted modifications to TRACKED files (`git status --porcelain`, the
    modified/added/deleted/renamed entries — not untracked).
.PARAMETER Untracked
    Paths git does not track at all (`git status --porcelain`, `??` entries).
.PARAMETER OldestUncommittedMtime
    [Nullable[datetime]] last-write-time of the OLDEST file among TrackedModified+Untracked.
    $null when the caller could not determine it (fail-safe: treated as infinitely old below).
.PARAMETER Ahead
    Commits this checkout has that origin does not (`origin..HEAD`).
.PARAMETER Behind
    Commits origin has that this checkout does not (`HEAD..origin`).
.PARAMETER IncomingPaths
    Paths the behind-commits touch (`git diff --name-only HEAD origin/main`). Only meaningful
    when Behind > 0; an empty list when Behind = 0 is expected, not a failure.
.PARAMETER Now
    Wall-clock time to compute age against. Mandatory — this function is pure, so "now" is
    supplied by the caller, never read internally (Get-Date would make this impure and
    untestable-by-fixed-clock).
.PARAMETER AgeThresholdHours
    Hours after which uncommitted work is considered stale enough to alarm. Default 24 (t/4005
    spec: "say 24h").
.OUTPUTS
    PSCustomObject { Name; Alarm; Reasons=[string[]]; AgeHours=[double]; Intersects=[bool];
    Diverged=[bool] }
