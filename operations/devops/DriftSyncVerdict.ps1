.SYNOPSIS
    Pure predicate: is an ff-sync of the shared checkout BLOCKED by real WIP that the incoming
    commits would actually overwrite? (t/3745 drift-check hold-predicate fix; TL p/331#1666-1674.)
.DESCRIPTION
    The bug this fixes: the drift check held (escalated owner-claim, blocked the sync) whenever ANY
    real WIP existed — `HasRealDiff` — regardless of whether that WIP intersects what's landing. But
    `git merge --ff-only` only refuses when the fast-forward would OVERWRITE a locally-modified file;
    a dirty file the incoming commits don't touch is carried through untouched. So "9 behind, one
    open editor on an unrelated file" blocked every sync for hours — the PROTOCOL, not git, was
    blocking (a real occurrence: LessonsLearned.md dirty, 9 incoming commits, none touching it).

    Correct hold predicate: **hold iff a real-WIP file is in the incoming change-set.**

        clean-behind (ahead=0, behind>0):  SyncBlocked = (RealWipFiles ∩ IncomingFiles) non-empty
        diverged     (ahead>0, behind>0):  SyncBlocked = (RealWipFiles.Count > 0)
                                           — the diverged path uses `reset --hard`, which overwrites
                                             EVERY local mod regardless of intersection, so the
                                             intersection carve-out is FF-ONLY; hold on any real WIP.
        current      (behind=0):           SyncBlocked = $false (nothing to sync).

    RealWipFiles already means "differs from origin/main modulo CRLF" (Get-DriftPhantomVerdict, exit
    0=phantom / 1|other=REAL), so a dirty file byte-identical to origin is already NOT real WIP and
    never blocks — no separate unique-vs-origin check is needed here.

    FAIL-CLOSED ARMS — three comparisons feed this, and each must refuse to read "empty ⇒ safe"
    (the recurring "infer safe from silence" trap):
      1. INCOMING set empty while behind>0 is IMPOSSIBLE (behind means there ARE incoming commits
         with changes). Treat an empty/failed incoming set with behind>0 as BROKEN → SyncBlocked,
         never as "no intersection ⇒ safe." (`$IncomingKnown = $false` signals the caller's git
         diff failed or returned nothing.)
      2. WIP set — RealWipFiles comes from Get-DriftPhantomVerdict, which already fails a failed
         git-diff toward REAL. A $null list here is treated conservatively as "unknown ⇒ blocked".
      3. unique-vs-origin — already inside RealWipFiles' classification (see above); its own
         failed-diff→REAL arm lives in Get-DriftPhantomVerdict.

    Untracked files are deliberately OUT of RealWipFiles (they are junk/suspicious buckets, not WIP)
    so an untracked file colliding with an incoming ADDED path is not held here — but `git merge
    --ff-only` refuses with "untracked working tree file would be overwritten", so git is the
    backstop: the cost is a failed sync attempt, not data loss (TL p/331#1674).

    PURE half: takes already-computed sets + counts, returns the verdict — both arms unit-testable
    without a git fixture. The impure git calls (behind/ahead counts, the incoming name-set) live in
    check-shared-drift.ps1. Mirrors DriftPhantomVerdict.ps1 / BranchStrandVerdict.ps1.
.PARAMETER RealWipFiles
    Dirty TRACKED files classified REAL (differ from origin/main) — from Get-DriftPhantomVerdict.
.PARAMETER IncomingFiles
    Paths the incoming commits change: `git diff --name-only HEAD..origin/main`. Meaningful only
    when $IncomingKnown is $true.
.PARAMETER Behind
    Commits the shared checkout is behind origin/main (HEAD..origin/main).
.PARAMETER Ahead
    Commits the shared checkout is ahead of origin/main (origin/main..HEAD). >0 with Behind>0 = diverged.
.PARAMETER IncomingKnown
    $false when the caller could not compute the incoming set (git error). Forces fail-closed.
.OUTPUTS
    PSCustomObject { SyncBlocked = [bool]; Conflicts = [string[]]; Reason = [string] }
