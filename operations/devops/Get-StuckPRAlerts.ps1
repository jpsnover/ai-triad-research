.SYNOPSIS
    Local escalation bridge (t/4115): surface stuck-PR SLA breaches and sweep-signature
    escalations to the DevOps agent via its scheduled Orca reminder.
.DESCRIPTION
    Impure runner, same shape as Get-CiAlertEscalations.ps1 (t/3912): `pr-triage.yml`
    (operations/devops/stuck-pr-classifier.mjs) is the pure classifier + the impure
    fact-fetch/labelling step, both running IN GitHub Actions, which cannot call Orca MCP
    tools (resolve_owner, send_ping). This script closes that gap: it reads what the
    workflow already labelled, and returns a verdict object. The CALLER (the reminder
    prompt, run by an agent) acts when ShouldAct is true -- it is this script's job to
    surface the facts, never to call send_ping itself (this file has no MCP access either;
    it just runs as a plain script under gh).

    A gh failure is NOT read as "nothing to report" (same rule as t/3912 cond 1): it returns
    ShouldAct=$true with QueryError set.
