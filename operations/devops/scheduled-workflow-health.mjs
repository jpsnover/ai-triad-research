/**
 * Scheduled-workflow health (t/4058) — the gap main-ci-monitor leaves open.
 *
 * main-ci-monitor answers "is the tip of `main` broken?" by observing PUSH-event runs. Scheduled
 * workflows never run on push, so they were unmonitored: deploy-drift-check crashed (exit 141) on 7
 * consecutive runs, compliance-live failed every day since its first run (its token was never
 * provisioned), dependabot-weekly failed every Monday, cluster-conflicts every Sunday for 6 weeks —
 * all with nothing escalating (t/4058#1). This module judges each DECLARED scheduled workflow from
 * its recent `schedule`-event runs; main-ci-monitor's scheduled path feeds it and routes problems
 * through the existing `alert-escalated` latch, which DevOps' hourly r/23 bridge surfaces.
 *
 * DECLARED, not inferred (scheduled-workflows.json): each entry carries its own silence budget, and
 * the lint in the test suite fails when a workflow with `schedule:` is missing from the list — an
 * unlisted scheduled workflow is the surviving vector, so the list is checked, not trusted.
 *
 * Two failure shapes:
 *   - FAILING: the most recent >= FAIL_STREAK completed scheduled runs all concluded failure-like.
 *     One red is tolerated (a transient blip); two in a row is a pattern.
 *   - SILENT:  no scheduled run created within maxSilentHours (GitHub throttles cron hard — a
 *     `*\/15` workflow was observed 6h between runs — and auto-disables a schedule after 60 days of
 *     repo inactivity), or never any scheduled run at all.
 * PURE: no I/O.
