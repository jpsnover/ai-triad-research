# was never tested).

# Exit: 0 = suite green AND >0 tests collected; non-zero otherwise.

# Population assertion (t/3819 Finding 2 / zero-collected class) — a FLOOR, not `> 0`.
# Measured while building this (t/3871): `node --test` on a file with NO tests exits 0 and reports
# `# tests 1` (the file itself counts as a test), so a `> 0` check PASSES an empty suite — the exact
# silent-zero trap. A floor at the known count catches that AND a refactor that quietly drops tests.
# RATCHET — and it DRIFTS if you don't move it (TL p/331#1816; same failure as Verify-Config's
# hardcoded "7 files" while running 8): when you ADD tests to merge-guard-predicate.test.mjs, RAISE
# MIN to the new count in the same PR. A floor left at an old count silently tolerates losing every
# test added since. Lowering MIN is a deliberate, reviewed diff (workflow-lint ALLOW_IF_EXPECTED
# pattern). The env override is for local arm-testing only.
