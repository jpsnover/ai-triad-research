/**
 * main-CI monitor (t/3737) — answers "is the tip of `main` broken?" and alerts an acting role when
 * it is, so a red `main` cannot sit unobserved (the incident: a recorded red that notified nobody).
 * Pure verdict here; the impure gh fetch + issue/notify live in the CLI shim below and the workflow.
 * Test == runtime: the shim feeds classifyMainCI the exact shape the tests use.
 *
 * DETECTION MODEL — OBSERVE WHAT RAN, DON'T MODEL WHAT SHOULD HAVE (TL ruling, t/3737#11,
 * p/331#1626). The earlier "all REQUIRED contexts success on the head" model was WRONG: required
 * contexts answer "may this PR merge?" (enforced on the PR head at merge time), NOT "is the tip
 * broken?". Most required contexts never re-post on main's post-merge head — `joint-gv-guard` is
 * `pull_request`-only (never on main's head), `CodeQL`/`ci-gate` are path-gated — so requiring them
 * on the head false-fires every merge. The fix is to stop modelling triggers entirely:
 *
 *   main is RED  ⟺  a `push`-event workflow RUN on the head SHA concluded failure/cancelled.
 *
 * Zero trigger-modelling → nothing to drift from the YAML. A workflow's conclusion counts WHEN it
 * runs; there is nothing to wait for when a path filter skips it (skips create no run). New push
 * workflows are covered with no list to maintain. The required-contexts list is OUT of detection —
 * kept only as the SSOT cross-check (crossCheckSsot).
 *
 * GRADED, not suppressed (TL): the designated main-health workflow is `CI` (HEALTH_WORKFLOW) — its
 * failure is a FULL alert. Any OTHER push-event workflow concluding red is a separate LOWER-severity
 * notice, never silently dropped.
 *
 * CI-ABSENT boundary (TL ruling, p/331#1629): `paths-ignore` (e.g. a docs-only push) fires NO push
 * workflow at all — verified: `5de42009`/`295d5d8a`/`ae1cdda6` each have push-runs=0, and that is the
 * CORRECT, permanent state for those heads. So:
 *   - absent entirely (no run of the health workflow) → UNKNOWN, **NO alert** (not even a low notice —
 *     deciding a run *should* have fired is exactly the trigger-modelling we declined).
 *   - created but UNCONCLUDED past the deadline → alert (guards a hung/stuck run).
 * Accepted trade, named as a blank: this cannot catch "CI never started when it should have." The
 * known remedy if we ever want it is a cron-triggered always-fires canary — NOT now (t/3737#11).
 *
 * DEADLINE: sized from the slowest push run's observed worst-case wall-clock (`ci-gate` inside `CI`,
 * measured max 13m11s over 8 same-day `main` runs, TL p/331#1600) × ~2.3 for runner contention =
 * 30 min. OBSERVED-NOT-BOUNDED (8 samples, ~1 day) — revisit if a legitimate run exceeds it.

//
// ⚠️ DO NOT cite that cross-check as "covered" — as of 2026-09-29 it is performed NOWHERE (TL
// p/331#1633). `RequiredContextsDriftVerdict.ps1`'s predicate is Pester-tested, but its live-API
// runner `Test-RequiredContextsListDrift.ps1` is invoked by no workflow or script (only a descriptive
// comment in required-contexts.json names it) — a t/3695-shape dead execution layer (pure half tested,
// impure half never runs). Wiring that orphaned runner as its OWN scheduled job (separate routing +
// liveness, advisory) is tracked at t/3741. It must NOT be bolted onto this monitor's self-health —
// coupling would make the main-CI health check assert less than it appears (the t/3737#3/#4 defect).

// event per episode: label ESCALATED_LABEL + assign the owner + an @mention comment. The label is the
// once-per-episode latch; an episode ends when the issue auto-closes, and a recurrence opens a NEW
// issue (a new episode). The local Orca bridge (Get-CiAlertEscalations.ps1, hourly reminder) reads
// that label to reach the DevOps agent — GitHub notifications alone demonstrably reached no one.
