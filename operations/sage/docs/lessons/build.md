# Build Patterns

Failure patterns related to builds, CI, tooling, environment, and git operations.

## [Build] Bash Dollar-Sign Variable Substitution Corrupts Code

**Pattern:** Bash interprets dollar-sign expressions in commands as variable substitution, corrupting code that uses dollar-sign syntax (JS template literals, PowerShell variables like `$_`).

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-21 — Shared Lib agent: sed commands with JS `${activePovers.length}` caused "bad substitution" (p/5#1).
- 2026-05-21 — Technical Lead: PowerShell `$_.ToString()` mangled by bash string interpolation. Resolved by restructuring the command to avoid `$_` in bash context (p/8#5).

**Root Cause:** Bash expands dollar-sign expressions (`${...}`, `$_`, `$var`) before passing them to the target command. This silently corrupts or errors on code from languages that also use dollar-sign syntax (JS/TS template literals, PowerShell variables).

**Prevention:**
1. Prefer line-number addressing for sed over pattern matching when patterns contain dollar-sign syntax.
2. Use the dedicated Edit/Write tools instead of Bash sed/heredoc when target code contains dollar-sign expressions.
3. If Bash is unavoidable, restructure commands to avoid dollar-sign segments, or write a temp script and execute it.
4. Root AGENTS.md File Editing Rule now codifies this (q/4 approved, p/8#7).

**Status:** Resolved — systemic prevention via AGENTS.md rule.

**Applies To:** All agents using Bash to edit/run TypeScript, JavaScript, PowerShell, or any code with dollar-sign syntax.

## [Build] Bash Heredoc Failures with Nested Quotes

**Pattern:** Bash heredocs and `bash -c`/`pwsh -Command` wrappers fail when the embedded code contains nested single quotes — common across Python, PowerShell, and TSX/JSX string literals.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-21 — Taxonomy Editor agent hit heredoc failures twice when running Python code containing TSX string literals with nested single quotes (p/6#1).
- 2026-05-24 — PowerShell agent: `pwsh -Command '...'` with embedded PowerShell single-quoted strings caused `unexpected EOF while looking for matching backtick`. Fixed by replacing inner single-quoted strings with double-quoted strings (p/20#3).
- 2026-05-24 — Computational Linguist: Bash heredoc failed again on a large Python analysis script with apostrophes in f-strings. Fixed by splitting into two scripts (data collection to `/tmp/belief_signals.json`, then analysis) and using %-formatting instead of f-strings to avoid apostrophes (p/7#7).
- 2026-06-17 — Sync: `git commit -m @'...'@` in Bash tool errored — `@'...'@` is PowerShell here-string syntax, Bash split the multi-line message into stray pathspec args. Fixed by writing commit message to temp file and using `git commit -F <file>` (p/77#1).
- 2026-06-17 — ServerAPI: same `@'...'@` in Bash issue, compounded by placing `-m` after `--` separator — everything after `--` is treated as pathspecs, so the message flag was ignored entirely. Fixed with `git commit -F <file> -- <paths>` (message flag before `--`) (p/79#1).
- 2026-06-17 — DebateUI: `@'...'@` in Bash tool leaked a literal `@` into a commit subject on shared branch. Part of a larger incident where amend clobbered another agent's commit (p/83#1).

**Root Cause:** Heredocs (even quoted `<< 'EOF'` which disable variable expansion) still cannot contain the same quote delimiter used by the inner language. The `bash -c` and `pwsh -Command` wrappers compound this by adding another quoting layer. Additionally, PowerShell-specific syntax (`@'...'@` here-strings) is silently misinterpreted by Bash, not rejected — leading to confusing errors. The `--` separator compounds commit message issues: all flags must come before `--`, or git treats them as pathspecs.

**Prevention:**
1. **First choice:** Use the Write tool to create a temp `.py` script file, then execute it with Bash — avoids all quoting issues.
2. Split complex scripts into smaller pieces that each avoid quote conflicts, passing data via temp files (e.g., JSON to `/tmp/`).
3. In Python, use %-formatting or `.format()` instead of f-strings when the content will pass through Bash.
4. For PowerShell via Bash, use double-quoted strings inside the command to avoid single-quote nesting.
5. Prefer the Edit/Write tools over Bash heredocs for file creation/modification.
6. For git commits: use `git commit -F <tmpfile> -- <paths>` — write message to temp file, and always place flags before the `--` separator.

**Status:** Resolved — AGENTS.md rule broadened to cover both file editing and script execution (p/8#14). Original rule from q/4 now includes: write scripts to temp files with Write tool, then execute via Bash.

**Applies To:** All agents using Bash heredocs to run or generate code with nested quoting across languages.

## [Build] Git Commit Fails Without user.name/user.email

**Pattern:** `git commit` fails on fresh clones or new machines when global git config lacks `user.name` and `user.email`.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-21 — Orca Support hit commit failure on a fresh clone without global git config (p/13#6).

**Root Cause:** Git requires `user.name` and `user.email` to create commits. Fresh environments (new machines, containers, CI without config) lack these by default.

**Prevention:**
1. Set repo-local config: `git config user.name "Name"` and `git config user.email "email"`.
2. Consider adding git config setup to post-create scripts (e.g., `.devcontainer/post-create.sh`) for containerized environments.
3. Agents should check for git config before attempting commits in unfamiliar environments.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents making git commits, especially in fresh or containerized environments.

---

## [Build] Missing or Unavailable CLI Tools/Services in Dev Environment

**Pattern:** Commands fail because CLI tools are not installed or required background services are not running.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-23 — DevOps: `az` CLI not found in bash or PowerShell. Used `gh` CLI as fallback for workflow checks (p/26#1).
- 2026-05-28 — Taxonomy Editor: `docker image ls` returned exit code 1 with no output because Docker Desktop daemon was not running. Fixed by starting Docker Desktop and waiting for daemon initialization (p/6#9).

**Root Cause:** Dev environment may lack CLI tools (Azure CLI not installed) or required background services (Docker Desktop daemon not running). Both fail silently or with unhelpful exit codes.

**Prevention:**
1. Before using a CLI tool, check availability with `command -v <tool>` or `Get-Command <tool>` and fall back gracefully if missing.
2. For Docker commands, first verify the daemon is running: `docker info > /dev/null 2>&1`. If it fails, start Docker Desktop and wait for initialization.
3. When a tool is unavailable, prefer alternative tools already installed (`gh` instead of `az`) over blocking.
4. When a command returns exit code 1 with no output, suspect a missing tool or stopped service before debugging the command itself.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents running CLI commands, especially DevOps, Docker, and CI-related work.

---

## [Build] Node.js Cannot Directly Execute TypeScript Source Files

**Pattern:** `node -e` or `node <file>` fails when importing TypeScript `.ts` files or referencing `.js` extensions for files that only exist as `.ts` — there are no compiled `.js` outputs.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-23 — Shared Lib: `node -e` with ESM import of `.js` extension failed because the TypeScript source files aren't compiled to `.js`. Vitest handles transpilation internally but raw Node.js doesn't (p/5#5).

**Root Cause:** This project uses vitest for testing, which transpiles TypeScript on the fly. There is no build step that produces `.js` files. Raw `node` commands cannot import `.ts` files or resolve `.js` imports that don't exist on disk.

**Prevention:**
1. Use `npx tsx <file>` or `npx ts-node <file>` to execute TypeScript files directly.
2. For debugging, read the source code with the Read tool rather than trying to execute it with `node -e`.
3. Run tests through vitest (`npm test`), not by invoking node directly on test files.
4. Do not assume `.js` files exist — check for a build/dist directory first.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents working with TypeScript source in the Electron apps or debate engine.

---

## [Build] Unix Paths in Node.js Fail on Windows

**Pattern:** Node.js commands using Unix-specific paths like `/dev/stdin` fail on Windows because Node resolves them as Windows paths (e.g., `C:\dev\stdin` → ENOENT).

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-24 — Taxonomy Editor: `node -e` with `/dev/stdin` pipe failed on Windows. Node resolved `/dev/stdin` as `C:\dev\stdin` which doesn't exist. Fixed by writing a temp `.mjs` script file instead of piping (p/6#5).

**Root Cause:** `/dev/stdin`, `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/null` and other Unix device paths don't exist on Windows. Node.js on Windows doesn't translate these — it treats them as literal file paths under the current drive root.

**Prevention:**
1. Avoid `/dev/stdin` piping patterns — write temp script files (`.mjs` or `.js`) and execute them directly.
2. Use platform-agnostic alternatives: `process.stdin` in Node.js code instead of `/dev/stdin` file paths.
3. For `/dev/null`, use `NUL` on Windows or use cross-platform libraries.
4. When writing Bash commands that run Node.js, remember the dev environment is Windows — test Unix-isms mentally before using them.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents running Node.js commands on this Windows dev environment.

---

## [Build] Bash grep Features Fail Silently on Windows/Git Bash

**Pattern:** `grep -P` (Perl regex) and `grep -o` with complex patterns fail silently (exit code 1, no output) on Windows Git Bash, with no error message indicating the feature is unsupported.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-27 — Computational Linguist sub-agent: both `grep -P` and `grep -o` with quoted JSON patterns produced no output on Windows/Git Bash. Resolved by using the Read tool instead of Bash grep for JSON field extraction (p/40#1).

**Root Cause:** Git Bash ships a minimal GNU grep that may lack PCRE (`-P`) support and handles complex patterns (especially with JSON special characters) differently than Linux grep. Failures are silent — no stderr, just exit code 1 — making them hard to diagnose.

**Prevention:**
1. Use the dedicated Read and Grep tools instead of Bash `grep` for file content inspection — especially for structured data like JSON.
2. For JSON field extraction specifically, use `python3 -c "import json; ..."` or `jq` instead of grep with regex.
3. Avoid `grep -P` entirely on this platform — PCRE support is not guaranteed in Git Bash.
4. When grep returns no output, suspect platform incompatibility before assuming the pattern doesn't match.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents using Bash grep on this Windows/Git Bash environment.

---

## [Build] Push Rejected Due to Stale Local (Multi-Agent Contention)

**Pattern:** `git push` rejected (non-fast-forward) because remote has newer commits from other agents working in parallel.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-24 — Project Manager: push to `ai-triad-data` rejected after `embeddings.json` modified both locally and remotely. Resolved with stash/pull --rebase/take theirs/push (p/31#1).
- 2026-05-24 — Technical Lead: push to code repo main rejected with 3 unpushed CI fixes. Resolved with stash/pull --rebase, merge conflict in `logger.ts` (kept cached `usePretty` approach), rebase --continue/stash pop/push (p/8#11).
- 2026-06-25 — DebateWorkspace: push to main rejected (non-fast-forward) due to remote having commits not in local. Resolved by stashing overlay files, `git pull --rebase`, restoring stash, then pushing (p/124#1).

**Root Cause:** Multiple agents work in parallel on the same branches. The window between local commits and push allows remote to advance, causing non-fast-forward rejections. More agents = more contention.

**Prevention:**
1. Pull immediately before committing: `git pull --rebase` then commit and push without delay.
2. For generated data files (`embeddings.json`, `policy_actions.json`), prefer "take theirs" conflict resolution unless your changes are the authoritative regeneration.
3. For code conflicts, understand the intent of both changes before resolving — don't blindly take either side.
4. Minimize the commit-to-push window — do both in quick succession.
5. Standard resolution flow: `git stash && git pull --rebase origin main` → resolve conflicts → `git rebase --continue && git stash pop && git push`.

**Status:** Active — 3 instances across 3 agents; approaching escalation threshold.

**Applies To:** All agents pushing to shared branches in either repo.

---

## [Build] Git Amend on Shared Branch Clobbers Other Agents' Commits

**Pattern:** `git commit --amend` on a branch with multiple concurrent committers rewrites another agent's commit when HEAD advances between the original commit and the amend.

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-17 — DebateUI: ran `git commit --amend` on `feat/phase-5c-diff-view` to fix a commit message. Between the original commit and the amend, another agent committed (t/651), moving HEAD. The amend rewrote that agent's commit with DebateUI's message, clobbering their work. Recovered via `git reflog` to find the original SHA, then `git reset --soft <sha>` to restore it (p/83#1).

**Root Cause:** `git commit --amend` rewrites the commit at HEAD. On a shared branch, HEAD can move between your commit and your amend if another agent commits in that window. The amend then targets the wrong commit — the other agent's — replacing their message and potentially their changes.

**Prevention:**
1. **NEVER use `git commit --amend` on a shared branch.** Create a new commit instead.
2. If a commit message needs fixing, use `git commit --allow-empty -m "corrected message"` or create a fixup commit.
3. `--amend` is only safe on personal/feature branches with a single committer.
4. Recovery: `git reflog` to find the clobbered commit's SHA, then `git reset --soft <sha>` to restore it (preserves index and worktree).

**Status:** Resolved — "Git Commit Rule (Multi-Agent)" added to root AGENTS.md covering amend and rebase on shared branches (p/8#25).

**Applies To:** All agents committing to shared branches (especially `main` and shared feature branches).

---

## [Build] Overlay Repo (ogit) Requires Special Git Handling

**Pattern:** The Orca overlay repo (`ogit`) has four recurring git pitfalls: (1) `ogit` is a shell alias unavailable in non-interactive shells (Bash tool), (2) `git add` rejects files that match the main repo's `.gitignore` — negation patterns can't re-include files under already-excluded parent dirs, (3) push contention occurs just like the main repo, (4) git flag ordering — `-- <pathspec>` must come AFTER all flags like `-m`.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-27 — Taxonomy Editor: `ogit add` rejected paths ignored by main repo's `.gitignore`. Fixed with `git add -f` since the overlay intentionally tracks files like `.orca.yaml` and `AGENTS.md` that the main repo ignores (p/6#7).
- 2026-05-27 — Taxonomy Editor: `ogit push` rejected due to remote having newer commits. Fixed with `git pull --rebase` then push (p/6#7).
- 2026-06-19 — ElectronMain: (a) `ogit` failed with "command not found" in Bash tool — it's a shell alias only available in interactive shells. Fixed by expanding to `git --git-dir=.orca-git --work-tree=.`. (b) `git add` of a new nested `AGENTS.md` rejected as "ignored by .gitignore" — `.orca-gitignore` has `!**/AGENTS.md` negation, but git can't re-include a file when its parent directory is already excluded. Fixed with `git add -f` (p/98#1).
- 2026-06-25 — Shared Lib: `ogit commit` failed with "pathspec '-m' did not match any file(s)" — `-- lib/AGENTS.md` pathspec was placed before `-m` flag, so git treated `-m` as a pathspec. Fixed by moving `-- lib/AGENTS.md` after `-m "message"` (p/5#11).
- 2026-06-25 — Conflict: `ogit add taxonomy-editor/.../conflict/AGENTS.md` failed ("paths are ignored by .gitignore") — same parent-dir exclusion issue as p/98#1, this time for a per-directory AGENTS.md under `taxonomy-editor/`. Fixed with `ogit add -f` (p/122#1).

**Root Cause:** (1) `ogit` is defined as a shell alias (`alias ogit='git --git-dir=.orca-git --work-tree=.'`), which is only loaded in interactive shell sessions — the Bash tool runs non-interactive. (2) The overlay repo shares the working tree with the main repo, so `.gitignore` affects `ogit add`. Negation patterns (`!**/AGENTS.md`) cannot re-include files when a parent directory is already excluded by a broader rule — this bites on every new per-directory AGENTS.md. (3) Multiple agents update overlay files in parallel, causing push contention. (4) Git argument ordering: `-- <pathspec>` must come last — placing it before flags like `-m` causes git to treat the flag as a pathspec.

**Prevention:**
1. **Never use `ogit` in the Bash tool** — expand it to `git --git-dir=.orca-git --work-tree=.` since shell aliases aren't available in non-interactive shells.
2. Always use `-f` (force) when staging overlay files — they will be gitignored by the main repo by design. This applies to both existing and new files, especially nested `AGENTS.md` files under already-excluded parent directories.
3. Before pushing, run `git --git-dir=.orca-git --work-tree=. pull --rebase` to incorporate remote changes.
4. Must be run from the repo root — `.orca-git` is not visible from subdirectories.
5. Never use `git add` or `git commit` for overlay-tracked files — always use the expanded overlay git command.
6. **Git flag ordering:** `-- <pathspec>` must be the LAST argument — `git commit -m "msg" -- path`, never `git commit -- path -m "msg"` (git treats `-m` as a pathspec).

**Status:** Resolved — root AGENTS.md rule (p/8#28) + `overlay-repo-guard` PreToolUse hook extended to catch both wrong-repo commits and missing `-f` on nested overlay files (p/9#13).

**Applies To:** All agents committing to the overlay repo (AGENTS.md, .orca.yaml, .orca/ directory).

## [Build] Docker Build Fails Due to Wrong Relative Import Path Depth

**Pattern:** TypeScript relative import paths that work in the source tree break inside Docker build contexts when the file's depth relative to the imported module differs from the source layout.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-28 — Taxonomy Editor: Docker build failed with TS2307 `Cannot find module '../../lib/debate/types.js'` in `server.ts`. The inline `import()` type had wrong relative path depth (2 levels instead of 3). Fixed by changing to `../../../lib/debate/types.js`. Commit 25a1e15 (p/6#11).

**Root Cause:** Docker COPY commands and build context can change the relative directory structure compared to the source tree. Relative import paths must account for the file's position within the Docker build context, not just the source repo layout.

**Prevention:**
1. When adding cross-directory imports in Dockerized code, count path depth from the file's location in the build context, not the source repo.
2. After modifying imports in Docker-built code, verify with `tsc --noEmit` inside the Docker build (or a local dry run) before pushing.
3. Consider using tsconfig path aliases to avoid fragile relative paths in Docker builds.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents working on Docker builds that include TypeScript with cross-directory imports.

---

## [Build] CI Workflow Lacks workflow_dispatch Trigger

**Pattern:** `gh workflow run ci.yml` fails because the CI workflow only has `push` and `pull_request` triggers — no `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-28 — Diagnostics: attempted `gh workflow run ci.yml` but the workflow doesn't have `workflow_dispatch`. Resolved with an empty commit to trigger the push event (p/9#10).

**Root Cause:** The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is configured with `push` and `pull_request` triggers only. There's no `workflow_dispatch` trigger to allow manual or programmatic runs via `gh workflow run`.

**Prevention:**
1. To trigger CI without code changes, use `git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger CI" && git push`.
2. Consider adding `workflow_dispatch:` to `ci.yml` triggers for manual/programmatic runs.
3. Check workflow triggers before assuming `gh workflow run` will work: `gh workflow view ci.yml`.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents attempting to manually trigger CI workflows.

---

## [Build] Python Windows Encoding Default

**Pattern:** Python on Windows defaults to cp1252 encoding for both file I/O and stdout. Any operation involving non-ASCII characters (em dashes, arrows, accented names, Unicode quotes) fails or silently corrupts.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-22 — Technical Lead: `json.load()` failed on debate JSON files with UTF-8 characters because `open()` defaulted to cp1252 on Windows (p/8#9).
- 2026-05-25 — Computational Linguist: stdout encoding error — cp1252 can't encode Unicode arrow U+2192. Fixed by wrapping stdout with `io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')` (p/7#9).

**Root Cause:** Python's `open()` and `sys.stdout` use `locale.getpreferredencoding()` which is cp1252 on most Windows systems, not UTF-8. Both file I/O and subprocess stdout are affected.

**Prevention:**
1. Always pass `encoding='utf-8'` to `open()` when reading or writing JSON, markdown, or any text data files.
2. For stdout with Unicode content, wrap with `io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')`.
3. Use `json.loads(Path(f).read_text(encoding='utf-8'))` as an alternative pattern for file reads.
4. Consider setting `PYTHONUTF8=1` env var to force UTF-8 globally for Python processes.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents writing Python that reads/writes text files or prints Unicode, especially on Windows.

---

## [Build] Relative Paths Double When CWD Is Already the Target Directory

**Pattern:** Running a command with a relative path like `node lib/debate/script.mjs` fails with MODULE_NOT_FOUND when the CWD is already `lib/debate/`, because the path resolves to `lib/debate/lib/debate/script.mjs`.

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-16 — DebateTool: `node lib/debate/_add_stack.mjs` failed because CWD was already `lib/debate/`, doubling the path. Fixed by using absolute path (p/70#1).

**Root Cause:** Bash tool CWD may differ between calls or may have been changed by a prior `cd` command. Relative paths assume CWD is the repo root, but if a previous command changed directory, the relative path stacks on top of the current location.

**Prevention:**
1. Use absolute paths for `node`, `python3`, and other file execution commands — never rely on CWD being the repo root.
2. If using relative paths, verify CWD first with `pwd`.
3. Bash tool CWD persists between calls — a prior `cd` affects all subsequent commands in that shell session.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents executing scripts via Bash, especially when working across subdirectories.

---

## [Build] Azure Deploy False-Red from arm-deploy failOnStdErr + Bicep Warnings

**Pattern:** Azure deploy workflow reports failure even though the ARM deployment succeeds, because `azure/arm-deploy@v2` defaults `failOnStdErr:true` and Bicep emits compile warnings to stderr.

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-20 — Infrastructure (Azure): "Deploy to Azure" workflow false-red at "Deploy Bicep template" step. Initial diagnosis blamed an unregistered `Microsoft.AlertsManagement` resource provider — this was WRONG. The stale "Failure Anomalies" deployment in `az deployment list` was from 2026-05-24, not the current run. Registering the RP did not fix the issue. Real cause (confirmed via `gh run view <id> --log-failed`): `arm-deploy@v2` with `failOnStdErr:true` (default) treats Bicep compile warnings (BCP422/BCP318 from `deploy/azure/runner/runner.bicep`) as failures. Final log line: "Error: Deployment process failed as some lines were written to stderr". The ARM deployment itself succeeded. This skipped downstream workflow steps (blue-green gate, DEPLOY_SHA/DEPLOY_TAG stamping). Tracked in t/702 (p/99#1, corrected p/99#4).

**Root Cause:** `azure/arm-deploy@v2` defaults `failOnStdErr:true`. Bicep emits non-fatal compile warnings (BCP422, BCP318) to stderr. The action treats ANY stderr output as a deploy failure, even when the ARM deployment succeeds.

**Prevention:**
1. Set `failOnStdErr: false` on the `arm-deploy` action, OR eliminate the Bicep warnings causing stderr output.
2. Don't ignore false-reds — they mask genuine failures and skip downstream workflow steps (health gates, env-var stamping, traffic shifting).
3. **Diagnosis discipline:** Read the workflow STEP log (`gh run view <id> --log-failed`) AND check the failing deployment's TIMESTAMP before concluding. `az deployment list` top-of-list can surface month-old stale failures — don't trust it without checking dates.

**Status:** Active — tracked in t/702.

**Applies To:** DevOps agents managing Azure deployments via arm-deploy actions.

## [Build] Array Index on Empty Array Returns undefined — Silent Until Runtime Crash

**Pattern:** Accessing `array[0]` on an empty array silently returns `undefined` in JavaScript, which propagates until a downstream API rejects it — often far from the original empty-array site.

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-20 — Infrastructure (Azure): CI test-container failed for ~4 weeks. `NODE_ENV=production` (c1cf7ba7) made `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=[]` instead of `null`. `getCorsOrigin()` returned `ALLOWED_ORIGINS[0]` → `undefined`. Node.js 22's `setHeader()` strictly validates header values and threw `TypeError` on the `undefined` value on every request — server started but never responded. Fixed with `?? ''` nullish coalescing guard (a58ec59d, t/723). (p/105#1).

**Root Cause:** Two compounding issues: (1) `array[0]` on an empty array returns `undefined` without error — unlike null-access which would throw. The `undefined` propagated silently through the CORS origin pipeline. (2) Node.js 22 added strict validation to `setHeader()` — passing `undefined` as a header value now throws `TypeError`, whereas earlier Node.js versions silently coerced or ignored it.

**Prevention:**
1. Never use bare `array[0]` to extract a value — guard with `array[0] ?? fallback` or check `array.length > 0` first.
2. When a config variable can be an empty array, treat `[]` as a distinct case from `null`/`undefined` — they behave differently (`[0]` returns `undefined` vs throwing).
3. Node.js 22+ validates `setHeader` values strictly — any `undefined` or non-string value throws. Always validate values before passing to HTTP APIs.
4. When a server starts but never responds to requests, suspect a per-request crash (unhandled exception in middleware or header setup) — check container logs, not just health probes.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents writing server-side JavaScript/TypeScript, especially CORS and HTTP header configuration.

## [Build] Consumption-Tier ACA Outbound Uses Unpredictable SNAT IPs

**Pattern:** Azure Container Apps on consumption tier use Azure SNAT pool IPs for outbound traffic, not the environment's static IP. Any Deny-default firewall on dependent resources (Storage, Key Vault) blocks ACA access silently or with cryptic errors.

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-20 — DevOps: (a) Storage mount failed with error(13) — `defaultAction:'Deny'` on the Storage Account firewall blocked CIFS mount from consumption-tier ACA because outbound IPs are unpredictable SNAT pool addresses. Fixed by setting `defaultAction:'Allow'` in main.bicep. (b) Key Vault returned ForbiddenByFirewall (403) for the same reason — ACA is NOT a "trusted service" for Key Vault bypass, so the Deny-default firewall blocked it. Fixed the same way: `defaultAction:'Allow'` in main.bicep. (p/26#3).

**Root Cause:** Consumption-tier ACA does not have a fixed outbound IP — it uses Azure's SNAT pool, which rotates IPs unpredictably. Firewall rules that whitelist specific IPs or rely on "trusted Azure services" bypass don't work because ACA isn't in the trusted services list. VNet integration would fix this but exceeds cost targets for this project.

**Prevention:**
1. For consumption-tier ACA, set `defaultAction:'Allow'` on Storage Account and Key Vault firewalls in Bicep — IP-based Deny rules will break.
2. If security requires Deny-default, upgrade to Dedicated-tier ACA with VNet integration for predictable outbound IPs.
3. When a container mount fails with error(13) or Key Vault returns 403, suspect firewall + SNAT before debugging auth/permissions.
4. Test firewall rules with the actual ACA tier — what works in Dedicated (static IP) breaks in Consumption (SNAT).

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** DevOps and infra agents managing Azure Container Apps on consumption tier with firewalled resources.

## [Build] AUTH_OPTIONAL Mode Serves HTML to Unauthenticated API Requests

**Pattern:** When the server runs in AUTH_OPTIONAL mode, unauthenticated API requests receive a login page (HTML) instead of JSON responses, breaking automated test suites that expect API data.

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-20 — DevOps: Acceptance tests went 9/17 → 16/17 → 17/17 across iterations. Initial failures: unauthenticated API requests got HTML login page instead of JSON. Fixed by establishing an anonymous session cookie via `/.auth/anonymous` before running tests. Final failure: sync status test regex matched `"branch"` but actual field was `"session_branch"` — fixed by matching `"enabled"` instead (p/26#3).

**Root Cause:** AUTH_OPTIONAL mode redirects or serves HTML for requests without a session. API test clients that don't establish a session first receive HTML instead of the expected JSON, causing parse failures or assertion mismatches. Additionally, test assertions matched field names that differed from the actual response schema.

**Prevention:**
1. In AUTH_OPTIONAL mode, establish a session before API testing — call `/.auth/anonymous` to get an anonymous session cookie, then include it in subsequent requests.
2. When writing acceptance tests, inspect the actual API response body before writing assertions — don't assume field names from the codebase without verifying the wire format.
3. Prefer matching stable/enum values (like `"enabled"`) over field names that may have prefixes (like `"session_branch"` vs `"branch"`).

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents writing acceptance/integration tests against the deployed server, especially in AUTH_OPTIONAL mode.

## [Build] Git Commit-by-Pathspec Skips Untracked (New) Files

**Pattern:** `git commit -F msg -- <paths>` fails with "pathspec did not match any file(s)" when the paths include newly created files that haven't been staged with `git add`.

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-25 — DebateUI: `git commit -F msg -- <paths>` failed for newly-created files. Fix: `git add <new-files>` first, then pathspec commit. Self-resolved (deedd783, p/83#3).

**Root Cause:** `git commit -- <paths>` only commits changes to already-tracked files (modified or staged). Untracked (newly created) files are invisible to the pathspec — git doesn't auto-stage them. This is the expected git behavior but surprises agents accustomed to `git add -A` workflows.

**Prevention:**
1. Before `git commit -- <paths>`, check if any paths are new files: `git status --porcelain <paths>` — lines starting with `??` are untracked.
2. For new files, run `git add <new-files>` before the pathspec commit.
3. Pattern: `git add <new-files> && git commit -F msg -- <all-paths>`.

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents using pathspec commits (especially on shared branches where `git commit -- <paths>` is required by ADR-005).

## [Build] Bare Git Commit Sweeps Shared Staging Index

**Pattern:** Running `git commit` without a pathspec on a shared branch commits everything in the staging index — including files other agents have staged but not yet committed. Attempting to undo with `git reset --soft HEAD~1` after the commit reaches the remote can rewind another agent's already-landed commit, causing local/remote divergence.

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-25 — EdgeBrowser: bare `git commit` for t/1009 (3bde76f2) swept in 41 other agents' pre-staged files and pushed to origin/main. A follow-up `git reset --soft HEAD~1` attempted to undo it but rewound a different agent's already-landed commit, causing 1/1 local/origin divergence. Stopped all git surgery, escalated to TL/DevOps. No data lost; divergence mergeable (p/123#1).

**Root Cause:** Git's staging index is shared across all processes in the working tree. When multiple agents run `git add` in parallel, they all stage into the same index. A bare `git commit` (without `-- <paths>`) commits the entire index — not just the files the committing agent staged. The follow-up `git reset --soft HEAD~1` compounds the problem: if another agent committed and pushed between the original commit and the reset, HEAD~1 points to a different commit than expected, rewinding their work.

**Prevention:**
1. **Always use `git commit -- <explicit-paths>`** on shared branches — never bare `git commit`. This is ADR-005.
2. Never use `git reset` on a shared branch to undo a pushed commit — once it's on the remote, the commit is shared history. Escalate to TL/DevOps for recovery.
3. If you discover you've swept others' files into your commit but haven't pushed yet: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`, then re-commit with explicit pathspec.
4. If already pushed: do NOT rewrite history. Escalate — the correct fix depends on what other agents have already pulled/rebased on top of it.

**Status:** Active — ADR-005 pathspec rule already in AGENTS.md but this is the first recorded violation with real impact.

**Applies To:** All agents committing to shared branches (main, shared feature branches).

## [Build] Deploy Preflight Fails on CI Matrix Job Name Mismatch

**Pattern:** Deploy workflow preflight checks that match CI job names with exact string equality (`select(.name == "test-electron")`) fail when CI uses matrix strategy, which appends the matrix value to the job name (e.g., `test-electron (taxonomy-editor)`).

**Instances:**
- 2026-06-25 — DebateWorkspace: Azure deploy (run 28192219897) failed at preflight because the jq filter `select(.name == "test-electron")` didn't match the actual matrix job name `test-electron (taxonomy-editor)`. Fix: update `.github/workflows/deploy-azure.yml` to use prefix matching (`startswith("test-electron")`) or check the overall workflow conclusion instead (p/124#2).

**Root Cause:** GitHub Actions matrix jobs are named `{job-name} ({matrix-value})`, not just `{job-name}`. Preflight scripts that do exact string matching on job names silently find no match, treating it as "job not found" rather than "job succeeded." This is fragile — adding or renaming matrix dimensions breaks deploy without any CI change.

**Prevention:**
1. Use prefix matching for CI job name checks: `select(.name | startswith("test-electron"))` instead of exact equality.
2. Alternatively, check the overall workflow conclusion (`conclusion == "success"`) rather than individual job names — more resilient to CI restructuring.
3. When adding matrix dimensions to CI jobs, grep deploy workflows for exact job name references: `grep -r "test-electron" .github/workflows/`.
4. Test deploy preflight after any CI workflow restructuring (adding/removing matrix dimensions, renaming jobs).

**Status:** Active

**Applies To:** All agents modifying CI workflows or deploy preflight checks.
