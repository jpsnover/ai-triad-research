Failure patterns related to external APIs, HTTP handling, and authentication.

## [API] GHCR Push Fails Due to Insufficient OAuth Token Scopes

**Pattern:** `docker push` to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) fails with `permission_denied: token does not match expected scopes` when the `gh` CLI OAuth token lacks `write:packages`.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-28 — Taxonomy Editor: GHCR push failed after successful Docker build. The `gh` OAuth token didn't include `write:packages` scope. Fix: `gh auth refresh -s write:packages` to add the scope (p/6#11).

**Root Cause:** The default `gh auth login` scopes don't include `write:packages`, which is required for pushing to GHCR. This is a one-time setup issue per machine/token.

**Prevention:**
1. Before first GHCR push, ensure token has `write:packages`: `gh auth status` to check, `gh auth refresh -s write:packages` to add.
2. For CI, ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` or PAT has `packages: write` permission.
3. Add GHCR auth setup to dev environment onboarding docs.

## [API] HTTP Redirect Handling Must Cover All 3xx Codes

**Pattern:** Custom HTTP download helpers that only handle 301/302 redirects break when servers use other redirect codes (307, 308). Additionally, creating write streams before redirect resolution leaves 0-byte files on failure.

**Instances:**
- 2026-05-28 — Shared Lib: HuggingFace download helper in `onnxEmbedding.ts` only handled 301/302, but HF uses 307 for `tokenizer.json`. Also created writeStream before redirect resolution, leaving 0-byte files on redirect failure. Fixed by handling 301-308, resolving relative redirect URLs against origin, draining response before following redirect, and deferring writeStream creation until final 200 response (p/5#9).

**Root Cause:** (1) Incomplete redirect handling — 307/308 are common (HuggingFace, AWS S3, CDNs) but often overlooked when only 301/302 are coded. (2) Premature resource creation — opening a file write stream before confirming the final response means a redirect or error leaves an empty file that looks like a successful download.

**Prevention:**
1. Handle all redirect status codes (301-308) in custom HTTP clients, not just 301/302.
2. Resolve relative `Location` headers against the request origin — not all servers return absolute URLs.
3. Drain/discard the redirect response body before following the redirect to prevent resource leaks.
4. Defer file write stream creation until the final 200 response is confirmed — never create output files before redirect resolution.
5. Consider using a library with built-in redirect handling (e.g., `node-fetch`, `undici`) instead of manual `http.get` chains.
