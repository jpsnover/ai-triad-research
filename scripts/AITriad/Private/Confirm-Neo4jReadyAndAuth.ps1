function Confirm-Neo4jReadyAndAuth {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Install-GraphDatabase's Step 6/6b: wait for Neo4j to come up, then AUTHENTICATE
        against it with the intended credential (t/3877 -- extracted verbatim from
        Install-GraphDatabase to bring that function's complexity back under its
        complexity-ratchet baseline; no behavior change).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Polls http://localhost:7474 until ready or timeout. On ready, makes ONE
        AUTHENTICATED request (Test-Neo4jAuthProbe) — the HTTP port being up does NOT
        prove the credential took; if the image ignored NEO4J_AUTH_FILE it is running on
        DEFAULT credentials (SO cond.1). Fails LOUDLY on a confirmed credential mismatch
        rather than silently shipping a default-cred DB.

        -PassThru emits the verified [PSCredential] on the pipeline (as a bare Write-Output,
        reaching the CALLER's pipeline transparently) only on the one path where authentication
        was actually confirmed this invocation — every other outcome (timeout, unauthorized,
        unreachable) warns naming why and emits nothing (the single invariant, SO e/242#2).
    .PARAMETER ContainerName
        The running container's name, for log/remediation text only.
    .PARAMETER Principal
        Resolved username to authenticate as. Named Principal, not "User" (paired with a
        "Password"-named parameter below), to avoid PSAvoidUsingUsernameAndPasswordParams --
        same convention as ConvertTo-Neo4jCredential's -Principal/-Secret.
    .PARAMETER Secret
        Resolved plaintext password to authenticate with (point-of-use materialization;
        not persisted here). Named Secret, not "Password", for the same PSSA reason.
    .PARAMETER AuthFile
        Path to the short-lived host auth-secret file — scrubbed to zero bytes on confirmed
        auth, left in place (with a warning) on any unconfirmed outcome (SO cond.2: fail-open
        is the dangerous case, so the file is never deleted on a path that didn't prove auth).
    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Emit the authenticated [PSCredential] on the pipeline when verification succeeds.
    .OUTPUTS
        [PSCredential] on the pipeline when -PassThru and authentication succeeded. Nothing
        otherwise. Throws New-ActionableError when the container is reachable but confirmed
        to have rejected the intended credential.
