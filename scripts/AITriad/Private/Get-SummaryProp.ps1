    .SYNOPSIS
        Reads a named member from a summary object, whether it is an [ordered]
        hashtable or a PSCustomObject.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Summary objects take two shapes in the pipeline:

          * In-memory merged summaries (Merge-ChunkSummaries) are [ordered]
            hashtables whose entries are NOT visible via PSObject.Properties.
          * Single-shot summaries and re-parsed JSON are PSCustomObjects whose
            NoteProperties ARE visible via PSObject.Properties (and, for
            dictionaries, key access via .Contains/[$Name]).

        Under Set-StrictMode -Version Latest, touching a missing property throws.
        This reader returns $null for a missing member on either shape, so a
        single malformed chunk degrades gracefully and the density checker sees
        the same values the merge writer stored.
    .PARAMETER Object
        The container to read from (dictionary, PSCustomObject, or $null).
    .PARAMETER Name
        The member/key name to read.
    #>
    param($Object, [string]$Name)

    if ($null -eq $Object) { return $null }
    if ($Object -is [System.Collections.IDictionary]) {
        if ($Object.Contains($Name)) { return $Object[$Name] } else { return $null }
    }
    $Prop = $Object.PSObject.Properties[$Name]
    if ($Prop) { return $Prop.Value } else { return $null }
}
