# ── Centralized dirty-tree-sweep guard for data-repo writes (t/2902 Part 2) ──
# The single chokepoint every data-of-record write funnels through. It asserts the
# SPECIFIC target file is clean vs HEAD before a whole-file rewrite, so concurrent
# uncommitted working-tree state can't be swept into the commit (t/2896: 128ce8f4
# swept sit-477). Per-FILE-dirty — NOT a whole-tree assertion (the data tree is
# perpetually dirty; a whole-tree gate would false-block at scale). Delegates the
# actual git check to Assert-CleanDataTree (Part 1).
#
# SCOPE (CL, t/2902#16): this guards the SAME-FILE sweep (t/2896 — a whole-file
# rewrite bundling concurrent edits to that file). It does NOT cover the CROSS-FILE
# `git add -A` sweep (the license-drift sibling) — that is the explicit-paths
# staging rule's job (root AGENTS.md junk-file-hygiene), not this per-file guard.
#
# TIERED mode (t/2909, TL ruling t/2909#3) — the guard mode is per-TARGET, not global:
#   BLOCK tier — low-traffic / usually-clean / high-sensitivity files: situations.json,
#     organization_stance_claims.json, and the registries. Real sweep prevention with
#     near-zero false-fire (usually clean between writes).
#   WARN tier  — high-traffic perpetually-dirty files (POV camp files, edges.json,
#     embeddings.json, summaries): ~always dirty from concurrent pipeline WIP, so
#     per-file Block can't tell own-WIP from foreign-WIP and would throw constantly.
#     The durable fix there is FIELD-SURGICAL writes (t/2916), not Block.
# $env:AI_TRIAD_DATA_WRITE_GUARD (Block|Warn|Off) is a GLOBAL override that wins over
# the tier for every path (testing / emergency de-escalation).

# BLOCK-tier targets by basename (case-insensitive). Keep in LOCKSTEP with the Python
# guard's _BLOCK_TIER_FILES (scripts/data_tree_guard.py) — update both together.

function Assert-DataWriteAllowed {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Sink-level dirty-tree-sweep guard. Call immediately before any whole-file
        rewrite of a data-repo file. No-op unless the target is under the data root
        AND already carries uncommitted changes.
    .PARAMETER Path
        The target file about to be overwritten.
    .PARAMETER AllowDirty
        Opt-out for a writer that legitimately rewrites a target left dirty by a
        prior pass in the same sequence (t/2902 condition 4). Bypasses the guard.
        Semantics: "the tree is dirty and I am choosing to ignore that" — a blanket
        override. Do NOT use it for surgical writes; use -SurgicalWrite (below).
    .PARAMETER SurgicalWrite
        Distinct, semantically-honest exemption for a FIELD-SURGICAL write (t/2916,
        TL ruling t/2916#8). Its claim is NOT "ignore the dirty tree" but "this write
        is sweep-proof BY CONSTRUCTION, so the dirty-tree check is N/A." Earned only by
        Save-JsonNodeFieldEdits, whose every write goes through Update-JsonNodeField's
        re-parse-verify invariant + byte-identical foreign-WIP preservation (proven in
        Update-JsonNodeField tests 5/7 and SurgicalWriteExemption.Tests.ps1). Kept
        SEPARATE from -AllowDirty on purpose: the two carry different risk profiles, and
        overloading one flag would make a `grep -AllowDirty` unable to tell "provably
        safe surgical" from "blanket override — scrutinize." Reachable only via the
        orchestrator (enforced by the detection gate in SurgicalWriteExemption.Tests.ps1),
        so a whole-file writer cannot claim it and bypass the BLOCK tier.
    .OUTPUTS
        None. In Block mode a dirty data-target throws (New-ActionableError via
        Assert-CleanDataTree); in Warn mode it warns and proceeds.
