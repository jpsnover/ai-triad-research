.SYNOPSIS
    Preflight: assert the Azure CLI is installed and logged in, else throw an actionable error.
.DESCRIPTION
    Two checks the az-using cmdlets need before their first real call:
      1. `az` resolves on PATH (a bare `& az` otherwise throws a raw CommandNotFoundException,
         not an actionable error).
      2. `az account show` succeeds (confirms an authenticated context).
    Routes the account probe through Invoke-Az so callers can mock a single seam in Pester.
    This is the shared form of the login-preflight block that is otherwise copy-pasted across the
    Azure cmdlets; new az cmdlets should call it instead of re-inlining.
.PARAMETER CallerName
    Location string stamped into the thrown ActionableError (usually the calling cmdlet's name).
