.SYNOPSIS
    Allowlist of proposal fields Import-Entity accepts — the Entity contract field set (t/3133).
.DESCRIPTION
    Any `-Proposal` key outside this set is an UNKNOWN field and is rejected loudly by Import-Entity,
    instead of being silently dropped. Silent drop is the t/3118 near-miss: a stale (pre-t/3131)
    module didn't read `description_provenance`, dropped it, and the grandfather rule would have
    auto-approved unedited AI drafts. Loud rejection turns any stale-code / typo'd-field case into an
    immediate failure rather than silent data-correctness drift.

    This list MUST match the Entity contract (lib/entities/types.ts). The Entity drift-parity test
    asserts the two stay in sync, so a newly-added contract field can't be silently rejected here.
    `created_at` / `last_modified` are contract fields the cmdlet manages (ignored if echoed on a
    proposal) — included so a full-record round-trip is tolerated, not rejected.
