    .SYNOPSIS
        Cleans up unmapped concepts that already have matching taxonomy nodes.
    .DESCRIPTION
        When AI summaries are generated, concepts the AI couldn't map to existing
        taxonomy nodes are stored in the summary's unmapped_concepts array.
        As new nodes are added to the taxonomy, some of these "unmapped" concepts
        now have matching nodes.

        This cmdlet scans every summary's unmapped_concepts, fuzzy-matches each
        concept label against all taxonomy nodes (cross-POV), and removes concepts
        that match an existing node above the similarity threshold.

        The result: unmapped_concepts lists are cleaned up to only contain concepts
        that genuinely don't exist in the taxonomy yet.
    .PARAMETER DocId
        Wildcard pattern to limit which summaries to process.
        Default: '*' (all summaries).
    .PARAMETER Threshold
        Minimum Jaccard similarity to consider a match (default 0.40).
    .PARAMETER WhatIf
        Show what would be changed without writing files.
    .EXAMPLE
        Repair-UnmappedConcepts
        # Process all summaries.
    .EXAMPLE
        Repair-UnmappedConcepts -DocId '*constitution*'
        # Process only matching summaries.
    .EXAMPLE
        Repair-UnmappedConcepts -WhatIf
        # Preview changes without modifying files.
