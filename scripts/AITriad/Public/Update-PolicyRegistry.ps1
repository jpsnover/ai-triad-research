    .SYNOPSIS
        Rebuild and validate the policy action registry from taxonomy files.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Scans all POV and cross-cutting taxonomy files, collects every
        policy_actions entry, and rebuilds policy_actions.json.

        Detects and reports:
        - Orphaned policies (in registry but not referenced by any node)
        - Unregistered policies (referenced by nodes but missing from registry)
        - Stale member_count or source_povs fields

        Use -Fix to automatically repair issues (remove orphans, assign IDs
        to unregistered entries, update counts).

        This is the one registration entry point for every policy_actions writer (t/4004).
        Invoke-AttributeExtraction and Find-PolicyAction call it with -NodeId after their
        own writes, so IDs are minted by one implementation (Private/PolicyRegistryCore.ps1).
    .PARAMETER Fix
        Automatically fix detected issues.
    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Return a summary object.
    .PARAMETER NodeId
        Node-scoped mode (t/4004). Register only these nodes' policy_actions:
        mint IDs for their unregistered actions, re-add registry entries only for IDs
        they reference, and recount only the IDs in -PriorPolicyIds plus the IDs on
        these nodes now. Orphans are reported but never removed in this mode, so a
        scoped call never edits policies unrelated to the nodes just written.
    .PARAMETER PriorPolicyIds
        With -NodeId: the policy IDs the target nodes held BEFORE the caller's write.
        Recounting over these as well lets a dropped ID's member_count go down.
