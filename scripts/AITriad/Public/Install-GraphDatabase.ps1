    .SYNOPSIS
        Sets up a Neo4j instance via Docker for graph visualization and Cypher queries.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Pulls and runs the Neo4j Community Edition Docker container with persistent
        storage at ~/ai-triad-graphdb/. The container exposes:
        - Bolt protocol on port 7687 (for Cypher queries)
        - HTTP browser on port 7474 (for Neo4j Browser UI)

        If a container named 'ai-triad-neo4j' already exists, it will be started
        (not recreated) unless -Force is specified.
    .PARAMETER Force
        Remove and recreate the container even if it already exists.
    .PARAMETER Credential
        Neo4j credential (PSCredential — same type as Invoke-CypherQuery / Export-TaxonomyToGraph).
        Username defaults to 'neo4j'. Falls back to the NEO4J_PASSWORD env var (user 'neo4j'). If neither
        is provided, a random password is generated and printed ONCE — copy it to $env:NEO4J_PASSWORD or
        re-run with -Credential to reuse it.

        SECURITY NOTE (t/3830 + t/3833): typing this as PSCredential keeps the password out of
        $PSBoundParameters, transcripts, and shell history (PSSA-clean) — it is NOT an encryption boundary.
        The credential reaches the container via a bind-mounted NEO4J_AUTH_FILE (t/3833), so it is absent
        from the docker argv AND from `docker inspect` Config.Env (only the file PATH appears). A short-lived
        host file holds the secret during container init and is removed once an authenticated `RETURN 1`
        confirms the credential took; if it does not authenticate the install FAILS LOUDLY rather than
        silently leaving Neo4j on default credentials. (The host ACL restricts the host path only — on
        Docker Desktop/WSL2 it is not preserved inside the container VM, which is the intended reader.)
    .PARAMETER DataPath
        Path for persistent database storage. Default: ~/ai-triad-graphdb.
    .PARAMETER PassThru
        Emit a [PSCredential] on the pipeline (t/3839) so the install→query handoff can skip the
        plaintext $env:NEO4J_PASSWORD hop and pass straight to Invoke-CypherQuery/Export-TaxonomyToGraph
        via -Credential.

        SINGLE INVARIANT (SO e/242#2): a credential is emitted IF AND ONLY IF it has been
        authenticated against the running database during THIS invocation — the value's meaning
        never depends on which code path produced it. Every other outcome (unauthenticated,
        unreachable, timeout, install failure) emits nothing and WARNS naming why; it does not
        throw for this reason alone, since several of those paths are the install already
        succeeding at a different job (e.g. an already-running container).
    .OUTPUTS
        [PSCredential] when -PassThru is specified and the credential verified this invocation.
        Nothing otherwise (warnings explain why on every non-emit path).
