    .SYNOPSIS
        Phase 1 entity ontology (t/1806) — extracts person/artifact/event/legislation/
        institution entity proposals from source_evidence_index.json facts, resolves
        each against existing records BEFORE minting, and mints only the unmatched
        remainder via Import-Entity.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Mirrors Invoke-OrgStanceExtraction's structure (t/1553 Stage 1): per-node AI
        calls (parallel, sequential merge), an idempotence sidecar, fence-stripped
        JSON parsing, and a post-parse validator that drops malformed items into a
        counted bucket rather than failing the run.

        Corpus: source_evidence_index.json (a dict keyed by node id; each entry has
        `facts[]` with `claim` text). Per node, calls the `enrichment.entity-extraction`
        UsageID with template vars {{node_id}} and {{facts}} (the node's claim texts).
        The UsageID does not exist in ai-usages.json yet (t/1819 is its go-live
        dependency) — a preflight guard fails actionably rather than letting
        Get-UsageConfig's generic "not found" error surface.

        Response shape: `proposals[]{name, entity_type, aliases[], quote, confidence}`
        plus `org_mentions[]{name}` (captured for traceability only — Phase 1 mints
        no organization records and creates no links from org_mentions).

        entity_type -> dolce_category (frozen mapping, lib/entities/types.ts):
          person -> agentive-physical-object
          artifact -> non-agentive-functional-artifact
          event -> perdurant
          legislation -> normative-description
          institution -> non-agentive-social-object

        CONFIDENCE GATE (stipulated, design t/1806): proposals below -ConfidenceThreshold
        (default 0.6) are dropped and counted, never minted. Proposals in
        [-ConfidenceThreshold, -ConfidenceThreshold + -NearGateBand) are minted but
        flagged `near_gate` in the run report — a human reviewer prompt, not a rejection.

        PERSON EXCEPTION: person proposals are minted with NO `description` — Import-Entity
        already blocks *approving* a person without a human-authored description, but this
        cmdlet never even offers one, for any entity_type (Phase 1's schema carries no
        genus-differentia description field; `quote` is evidence, not a description, and is
        never repurposed as one).

        RESOLUTION BEFORE MINTING (per proposal, name/aliases normalized to
        lowercase+trim+collapse-whitespace):
          1. Exact/alias match against existing entities (name+aliases), organizations
             (name+short_name), taxonomy node labels (acc/saf/skp/situations), the
             dictionary (colloquial_term + standardized canonical_form), and policy
             actions (action text).
          2. EXISTING-ENTITY CANDIDATES (ADVISORY, t/4075): cosine of the proposal's
             name vector against existing entity name vectors (entity_embeddings.json, v1
             flat or v2 name_vector). This stage NEVER links (TL ruling p/360#571): distinct
             siblings score above any threshold (Claude 3.5 vs 3.7 Sonnet 0.987, GPT-4 vs
             GPT-5 0.879). The proposal mints normally, and up to 3 non-sibling candidates
             at or above -LinkSimilarityThreshold, plus every version sibling (flagged), are
             written to the sidecar's existing_entity_candidates[] with the run's
             embedding_model. version_sibling=false means only that no version difference
             was detected (tier/variant siblings such as Sonnet vs Opus are not detected),
             NOT that the pair is safe to merge. Review with Get-EntityExtractionCandidates;
             record a confirmed match with Import-Entity merged_into. A WARN is written
             when the stage is skipped or finds nothing.
          3. Within-run EXACT dedup: the proposal's normalized name OR any alias matches
             an already-minted within-run candidate's name OR alias (t/1880 bullet 1 —
             the pre-existing MatchIndex never sees freshly-minted siblings).
          4. Within-run NEAR-VARIANT surfacing (ADVISORY, t/1881): cosine >=
             -WithinRunSimilarityThreshold of the proposal's probe vector against
             already-minted within-run candidates. This stage does NOT link — name-only
             cosine false-merges sibling entities (GPT-4/GPT-4o 0.90, Gemini 3.5/3.6 Flash
             0.97) that score ABOVE true dups, so auto-linking would destroy a distinct
             entity. On a hit the proposal MINTS normally and the pair is written to the
             sidecar's possible_duplicates[] for a curator to review — a false positive
             costs a human glance, not an entity. WITHIN-RUN ONLY (fires with zero approved
             entities); cross-run near-variant surfacing is Phase 2.
          Steps 1 and 3 record a `linked` disposition and mint nothing (links are Phase 2);
          an unmatched proposal is queued for minting and every later within-run EXACT
          occurrence is `linked` to the id just minted. Steps 2 and 4 never link — they only
          surface. Probe vectors are batch-encoded once per node (not per proposal).
          Minting happens in sub-batches of <= 20 (Import-Entity's ValidateCount ceiling).

        IDEMPOTENCE: an entity_extraction_log.json sidecar (mirrors organization_stance_
        claims.json's role for Invoke-OrgStanceExtraction) records every successfully
        processed node id; re-runs skip them unless -Force. A node whose AI call/parse
        FAILS is never marked processed, so it is retried on the next run.
    .PARAMETER NodeId
        Restrict extraction to specific node id(s). Default: every node present in
        source_evidence_index.json with at least one fact.
    .PARAMETER MaxNodes
        Safety cap on nodes processed per run. Default: no cap.
    .PARAMETER Concurrency
        Parallel AI calls. Default 3 (same conservative default as Invoke-OrgStanceExtraction).
    .PARAMETER Model
        AI model id used for every extraction call, OVERRIDING the model the
        enrichment.entity-extraction UsageID resolves from ai-usages.json. Default:
        unset — the usage's configured model wins (currently claude-sonnet-4-6, whose
        Claude-shaped structured-output schema a gemini-flash model rejects with HTTP
        400, t/3123). Pass -Model only to deliberately override. Tab-completes against
        registered ids; validated by Test-AIModelId.
    .PARAMETER Force
        Re-extract for node ids that already have a log entry.
    .PARAMETER ConfidenceThreshold
        Minimum extraction_confidence to mint. Default 0.6 (stipulated, t/1806).
    .PARAMETER NearGateBand
        Width of the near-gate review window above -ConfidenceThreshold. Default 0.1
        (so [0.6, 0.7) is flagged `near_gate` when using the defaults).
    .PARAMETER LinkSimilarityThreshold
        Minimum cosine similarity against an existing entity name vector for that entity
        to be listed as an ADVISORY candidate in existing_entity_candidates[]. Default 0.60.
        It never links (t/4075); the name is kept for interface stability.
    .PARAMETER WithinRunSimilarityThreshold
        Minimum cosine similarity between a proposal and an already-minted WITHIN-RUN
        candidate (both freshly proposed this run) at which the pair is SURFACED as a
        possible duplicate in the sidecar — advisory only, never an auto-link (t/1881).
        A DISTINCT knob from -LinkSimilarityThreshold. Because a hit only surfaces a pair
        for curation (a false positive costs a human glance, not an entity), this is a
        surfacing threshold and the default (0.60) needs no calibration sign-off.
    .PARAMETER EntitiesPath
        Override entities.json path (fixtures/tests). Defaults to Get-EntitiesFilePath.
    .PARAMETER EmbeddingsPath
        Override entity_embeddings.json path (fixtures/tests). Defaults to
        Get-EntityEmbeddingsFilePath.
    .PARAMETER SourceEvidenceIndexPath
        Override source_evidence_index.json path (fixtures/tests).
    .PARAMETER OutputPath
        Override the entity_extraction_log.json sidecar path (data-repo taxonomy/Origin
        by default).
