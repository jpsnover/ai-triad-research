    .SYNOPSIS
        Generates/regenerates the PowerShell complexity-ratchet baseline (t/3829).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Peer of the TypeScript complexity-ratchet baseline (t/3820/t/3821), adopting
        its corrected semantics verbatim: per-FILE record of { max, countOver }, both
        offenders-only (max > Threshold), write-only-downward (never raises a recorded
        number -- a regression against the existing entry is simply not written, which
        leaves the old frozen value in place so Test-ComplexityBudget catches it on the
        next enforcement run), and a cured file (max drops to <= Threshold) is dropped
        from the baseline entirely rather than left as a stale entry.

        Write-only-downward uses Get-ComplexityBudgetVerdict's Pareto-dominance rule,
        not independent per-field minima -- independent minima would score a good
        decomposition (one 302-complexity function split into several smaller ones,
        which lowers max but raises countOver) as a regression. See
        Get-ComplexityBudgetVerdict's docstring for the full rule and why.

        Both this generator and Test-ComplexityBudget call Measure-CodeComplexity
        directly (via the shared Get-ComplexityScanTargets) as the SOLE complexity
        counter -- there is no second implementation to mirror, so there is nothing to
        parity-check and nothing that can silently diverge the way the TypeScript
        side's hand-mirrored ESLint-node-set once did (t/3829#11).

        Self-validates its own output before writing (t/3829#4's "make the generator
        assert its own output shape"): output key count must equal written+kept
        decisions, no two keys may collide case-insensitively, and -- t/3874 -- no
        emitted key may contain '\'. The last guard exists because Measure-CodeComplexity's
        File (via [System.IO.Path]::GetRelativePath) is OS-native-separated; a baseline
        generated on Windows and enforced on Linux CI never matched on ContainsKey, so
        EVERY baselined scripts/ file read as a brand-new offender there (t/3874, found
        via t/3871#3). Get-ComplexityScanTargets now normalizes to '/' at the source, so
        this assertion should never fire in normal operation -- it exists to catch a
        Windows regeneration silently reintroducing '\' if that normalization ever
        regresses, not to handle an expected case.
    .PARAMETER Path
    .PARAMETER Path
        Root directory to scan. Default: the scripts/ directory (same resolution as
        Measure-CodeComplexity's default) -- this IS the ratchet's scan scope; its
        leaf name is recorded verbatim as __meta__.scan.
    .PARAMETER BaselinePath
        Path to the baseline JSON file. Default: complexity-baseline.json directly
        under -Path.
    .PARAMETER Threshold
        The complexity threshold above which a file is considered an offender and
        gets a baseline entry. Default: 15 (matches the TypeScript peer's threshold
        and t/3824's sizing analysis). This is the canonical value -- change it only
        here; Test-ComplexityBudget reads it back from the baseline's own __meta__
        rather than carrying an independent default, so there is no second place for
        it to drift out of sync (t/3829#4's "parameter lives in two places" problem,
        eliminated rather than tied-by-convention).
