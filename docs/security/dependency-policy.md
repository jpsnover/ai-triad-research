# Dependency Policy

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-03
**Owner:** Technical Lead

This policy governs third-party dependency selection, license compliance, and vulnerability response for the AI Triad Research project. It turns the SBOM (`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`) from documentation into governance.

## License Policy

## Vulnerability Response SLA

| Severity | Response Time | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Critical (CVSS 9.0+) | 48 hours | Patch, upgrade, or remove. If no fix available, document mitigation and set a review date. |
| High (CVSS 7.0-8.9) | 7 days | Patch or upgrade. Dependabot PRs for high-severity should not sit unmerged. |
| Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9) | 30 days | Address in next scheduled maintenance cycle. |
| Low (CVSS < 4.0) | Next maintenance cycle | Address when convenient. Track in ticket if persistent. |

Response time starts when the vulnerability is reported (Dependabot alert, `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, or manual discovery). The clock runs on business days.

### Process

1. **Dependabot** creates PRs automatically for known vulnerabilities (npm, pip, GitHub Actions)
2. **Weekly audit** (`npm audit` + `pip-audit`) per maintenance schedule — Tech Lead triages, routes to owning agent
3. **Critical/High**: Tech Lead creates a ticket immediately, assigns to owning agent, sets due date per SLA
4. **Medium/Low**: Batch into maintenance tickets, address in the next cycle

### Executing a Dependency Security Bump (mechanics)

Hard-won from t/3440, t/3442, and t/3443. For a **transitive** npm dependency (the common case for Dependabot alerts):

**Overrides live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `overrides:`.** That block is the single source of truth for BOTH the root `pnpm-lock.yaml` and the standalone `taxonomy-editor/pnpm-lock.yaml` (which `scripts/sync-standalone-lockfile.mjs` regenerates from it). A member `package.json`'s own `overrides` block is **INERT**; pnpm ignores it here, so removing it does nothing (this misled the adm-zip triage twice). `pnpm update <pkg>` bumps only the direct edge and leaves transitive consumers on the vulnerable copy, so **force every instance with an override**.

**Do it in ONE atomic PR.** The pieces are coupled by CI gates and cannot be split across PRs:
1. Edit `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `overrides:`. Add or raise the floor, **capped to the patched line** (`">=X <next-minor-or-major"`) so root and standalone resolve the SAME version. (A bare `>=` once let the standalone and prod resolve a different version than CI verified; t/3283.)
2. `pnpm install --lockfile-only` regenerates the root lockfile.
3. `node scripts/sync-standalone-lockfile.mjs` regenerates the standalone lockfile. `lockfile-overrides-check` reds if it drifts from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
4. `cd taxonomy-editor && npm run licenses` regenerates the SBOM. Any version change shifts `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` and `oss-licenses.json`, and the t/2918 staleness gate reds `main` otherwise (t/3443).
5. Verify that the vulnerable-version grep is **empty on BOTH lockfiles** and `node .github/scripts/check-lockfile-overrides.mjs` is green.

**Before REMOVING an override, audit what it suppresses.** A `>=X` pin is frequently the active fix for a `<X` advisory, so removing it reopens the alert. Check `gh api .../dependabot/alerts` for what closes and reopens first. Keep security-relevant overrides, each with a **co-located comment** stating exactly what it closes and does not. As an example, adm-zip `>=0.6.0` closes the `<0.6.0` HIGH 4GB-alloc DoS, while the `<=0.6.0` symlink-follow MEDIUM has no patch and is accepted non-reachable (t/3442). Removing the pin reopened the HIGH.

**Overrides-block comments must be colon-space-free.** `check-lockfile-overrides.mjs` is a line parser, so any indented comment line containing a `word: word` (colon-then-space) is mis-read as an override entry and reds CI (t/3440; parser hardening tracked in t/3445). Use a semicolon or the word "then" instead of a `: ` in those comments.

**No patched version exists?** Then accept-with-rationale. Trace `pnpm why <pkg>`; if the vulnerable code path is unreachable (build-time-only, extracts our own artifacts, zero first-party/runtime use), route the dismissal to **Main TL** (security-surface gate, see Dismissal Rules above), then dismiss as `not_used` with explicit **re-open triggers** (a patched version ships, so bump instead; or the package gains a first-party or runtime consumer, so re-triage). Mind the 280-char `dismissed_comment` cap; the full chain, grep, and threat-model go on the ticket (t/2547 / t/2866 / t/3442).

**Acceptance is "verified on origin/main," not "PR merged".** Confirm the lockfile grep is clean AND the alerts actually close or dismiss.

## Code Scanning Alert Triage

GitHub's Security → Code scanning tab holds two unrelated queues under one number. Triage them separately; the combined total is not a meaningful metric.

| Queue | Tool | Owner | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source SAST | CodeQL | Tech Lead | A finding in code we wrote. Each one is individually actionable. |
| Container CVE | Trivy | DevOps | A CVE in a base-image or npm-global layer. Remediated by bumping the image, not by editing our code. |

**Count Trivy by unique CVE ID, never by alert count.** Every image build re-files the same findings against the image ref and the prior alerts do not auto-close, so the alert count inflates without any change in real exposure. As of 2026-08-03 the queue held 1,066 Trivy alerts covering 263 unique CVEs — a ~4x multiplier. Any SLA written against the alert count is unmeetable by construction.

### SLA Applicability

The Vulnerability Response SLA above applies to the **Trivy** queue by CVE severity, exactly as it does to Dependabot alerts.

For the **CodeQL** queue the SLA is different, because CodeQL severity measures query confidence rather than exploitability:

| CodeQL severity | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Critical / High | Fix or dismiss within 7 days. The CI gate blocks new high+ findings on a PR, so anything at this level on `main` means the gate was bypassed — investigate that too. |
| Medium / Low / Note | **Verdict** within 30 days, not necessarily a fix. A written "by design, here's why" closes the SLA. |

The distinction matters: the `codeql.yml` CI gate is **differential** — only *new* high+ findings fail a PR. Nothing in the medium backlog blocks anything, so the backlog only shrinks if someone works this schedule. It does not self-clear.

### Dismissal Rules

1. **Every dismissal carries a written justification** in `dismissed_comment` — source, sink, and why the flow is safe. "Looks fine" is not a justification.
2. **`dismissed_comment` is capped at 280 characters.** Over that, the API returns HTTP 422 and the cap is not named in the error body. Write: *verdict + the specific enforcing guard + ticket ref* — e.g. "By design. Path guarded by `assertSafePov` (fileIO.ts:92-100). Analysis: t/2100#1." The full source/sink analysis goes on the ticket, or in a code comment beside the flagged line. Prefer the code comment for by-design verdicts: tickets are archived, the code is where the next reader already is.
3. **Production code is confirmed by its owning agent before dismissal.** Route the alert to the owner, get the source/sink analysis on a ticket, then dismiss citing it. The TL does not dismiss production-code alerts on inspection alone.
4. **Analysis scripts and dev tooling** (`research/*/scripts/`, `taxonomy-editor/tools/`) may be dismissed as `won't fix` directly — not shipped surface. Say so in the comment. This exemption does **not** extend to scripts that run in CI: something executing on a GitHub-hosted runner with repo credentials gets an owner's read, not a triage-pass assumption.
5. **Never dismiss to make a number go down.** An alert that is real and unfixed stays open with a ticket reference.
6. **Who can apply a dismissal:** the Technical Lead role holds code-scanning write (`Bash(gh api -X PATCH .../code-scanning/alerts/*)`, role-scoped, granted 2026-08-03). No other role inherits it. Other agents supply the justification on a ticket; TL applies it.

## New Dependency Evaluation

Before adding any new dependency, evaluate against this checklist:

### Required Checks

- [ ] **License compatible?** — Must be on the Allowed list or get Review-Required approval
- [ ] **Actively maintained?** — Last commit within 12 months, issues triaged, not archived
- [ ] **Security track record?** — Fewer than 3 critical CVEs in the past year
- [ ] **Size reasonable?** — Check bundle impact (`npx bundlephobia <package>` or `npm pack --dry-run`). Reject if it adds >500KB for a utility function
- [ ] **No better alternative?** — Is there a lighter, more maintained, or already-included package that does the same thing?
- [ ] **TypeScript types available?** — `@types/*` package or built-in types. Untyped JS packages require justification.

### For Python Dependencies

- [ ] License compatible (check PyPI classifiers)
- [ ] Pinned to exact version in `requirements.txt` (no floating `>=`)
- [ ] No native compilation requirements that complicate container builds (or documented in Dockerfile)

### Documentation

When adding a new dependency, note in the PR description:
- Why it's needed (what it does that we can't do ourselves in <50 lines)
- License
- Bundle size impact
- Alternatives considered

## SBOM Management

- `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` is generated via `npm run licenses` and committed to the repo
- Regenerated before each release and verified in CI (diff check)
- Python SBOM: `requirements.txt` serves as the manifest; `pip-audit` checks vulnerabilities
- Covers direct and transitive npm dependencies via `generate-license-file`

## Audit Schedule

| Cadence | Task | Owner |
|---------|------|-------|
| Weekly | `npm audit` + `pip-audit` | Tech Lead (triage) → owning agent (fix) |
| Weekly | Review and merge Dependabot PRs | Tech Lead |
| Monthly | Full license scan — check for new UNLICENSED or banned licenses | Tech Lead |
| Per-release | Regenerate SBOM, verify currency | Taxonomy Editor agent |
