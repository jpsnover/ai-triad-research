.SYNOPSIS
    Regression tests for the t/1696 smoke-test Health-Checks cold-start false-red.
.DESCRIPTION
    Invoke-TaxEditorSmokeTest's Health phase used to call Test-TaxEditorHealth
    with the default MaxAttempts=1 (single ~15s probe, no retry). On a
    scale-from-zero cold start the first request exceeds the timeout, so both
    /healthz and /health report FAIL, sinking HealthOk (and OverallPass) even
    though the app is healthy — the very next Endpoint phase hit the now-warm
    container and passed (t/1657 prod re-verify, 2026-07-22).

    The fix threads cold-start-tolerant retry (HealthMaxAttempts /
    HealthRetryIntervalSec, defaulting to 5 / 10s) into the Health phase. These
    tests mock the innermost Invoke-HealthProbe so the REAL Test-TaxEditorHealth
    retry loop + the smoke-test wiring run together; the other three phases are
    stubbed so the orchestration runs offline. Start-Sleep is mocked for speed.
