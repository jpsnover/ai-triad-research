.SYNOPSIS
    Live-data compliance trip-wire for the situation BDI-decomposition check.
    Asserts the current situations corpus (../ai-triad-data) is fully decomposed.
.NOTES
    RELOCATED from the required `test-powershell` merge gate to a data-triggered /
    scheduled job (t/2324 TL decision; t/2331 DevOps job; t/2332 PowerShell move).

    WHY THIS IS NOT A CODE GATE: this asserts an exact live-corpus count, which is a
    property of the DATA repo, not of any code change. Sitting it in the code merge
    gate coupled every unrelated code PR to data-corpus completeness — a single
    non-decomposed situation (sit-471..475, t/2323) reds the whole fleet. It now runs
    where the data actually changes; regressions alert the data/PS owner instead of
    blocking code merges. The check *logic* stays covered in the code gate via a
    fixture-based test (tests/Test-OntologyCompliance.SituationBDI.Tests.ps1, t/2332).

    UPDATING THE BASELINE is still the intended way to record backfill progress:
    - 411->412 (t/1655): corpus grew by one net compliant non-deprecated situation.
    - 412->435 (t/1805): workflow-app v1.0.0 wrote sit-448..470 un-enriched; decomposed
      via enrichment.situation-bdi-decomposition, merged with CL sign-off.
    - 435->440 (t/2323): sit-471..475 added with flat-string interpretations; decomposed
      via enrichment.situation-bdi-decomposition.
    - 440->442 (t/3009): sit-476/477 added by pipeline sync (78c943cf) with flat-string
      interpretations; CL-authored per-POV BDI decomposition (t/3009#1). Recurring
      pipeline gap tracked as t/3011 (decompose-on-emit).
    - 442->450 (t/3673): corpus grew by 8 non-deprecated situations, sit-478..485, all
      added with flat-string interpretations. sit-478 was decomposed the same day
      (e0c34cc3); the remaining SEVEN (sit-479..485, from fdf393b3 "+39 nodes ... sit 7")
      sat non-decomposed and red-ed this trip-wire for 4 days before anyone noticed.
      Decomposed via enrichment.situation-bdi-decomposition (CL, data ffacb957);
      TL second-verified on the committed tree (450/450, Fail=0).
      FOURTH occurrence of the class. The boundary gate (t/3011) DID detect it on push
      and was not heard: job green via continue-on-error, alert idempotent onto an
      already-open issue, scheduled check red and unwatched. Enforcement + alerting
      fixes tracked as t/3671; scheduled-run visibility as t/3672.
    When this trip-wire fires, run the backfill on the flagged ids, then bump the count.
